  abstract = {Abstract                            In ‘Provisional notes on the postcolony’, Achille Mbembe argues that obscenity and grotesquery are essential characteristics of postcolonial regimes of domination and subordination. This article attempts to extend this insight for the study of contemporary African social formations. Drawing on examples from Central, Southern and West Africa, the article reflects on Mbembe’s particular emphasis on the               carnality of power               , especially power’s ability to (over-)carnalize social relations, by further demonstrating why this is useful for understanding the relations of domination and subordination in Africa.                        ,              Résumé                            Dans ses « Notes provisoires sur la postcolonie », Achille Mbembe soutient que l’obscénité et le grotesque sont des caractéristiques essentielles des régimes de domination et de subordination postcoloniaux. Cet article tente d’étendre cette perspective pour l’étude des formations sociales africaines contemporaines. S’appuyant sur des exemples d’Afrique centrale, australe et occidentale, l’article se penche sur l’accent particulier que Mbembe place sur la               carnalité du pouvoir               , notamment l’aptitude du pouvoir à (sur-)carnaliser les relations sociales, en démontrant ensuite pourquoi cela est utile pour comprendre les relations de domination et de subordination en Afrique.},

This study employs established computational stylometry methods based on character n-gram frequencies to investigate this case. Based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of stylistic similarities within the Senecan corpus, Octavia and Phoenissae emerge as outliers, while Hercules Oetaeus only stands out when the text is split in half. Subsequently, applying Bootstrap Consensus Trees (BCT) to a corpus of distractor texts, both disputed plays align with the Senecan cluster/branch. The General Imposters method confidently reports Seneca as the author of the disputed plays under various scenarios. However, upon closer examination of text segments, indications of mixed authorship arise. Based on computational stylometry, it appears that the disputed plays were in large part, but not wholly, written by Seneca.},

She shows how use became associated with life and strength in nineteenth century biological and social thought and considers how utilitarianism offered a set of educational techniques for shaping individuals by directing them toward useful ends. Ahmed also explores how spaces become restricted to some uses and users with specific reference to universities. She notes, however, the potential for queer use: how things can be used in ways that were not intended or by those for whom they were not intended. Ahmed posits queer use as way of reanimating the project of diversity work as the ordinary and painstaking work of opening up institutions to those who have historically been excluded from them"--},

To that end, we include results for two new BPoMP tasks of interest for limerick analysis – the word deletion task and the limerick completion tasks. We include a release of a data set for the deletion task. We also offer up a suite of an additional ten BPoMP challenges whose precise formulations still require detail.},

Specifically, I discuss how mainstream academia in the West reinscribes colonial and racial thinking by strategically reducing the vast theoretical contributions of racialised and Indigenous scholars to experiential insights or “stories.” As such, these critical contributions remain marginalized in the mainstream, western scholarly canon. In my analysis, I outline the need for race-based epistemologies, in order to resist the ideological, discursive and material racism in research and knowledge production. I also argue that employing critical white supremacy as a theoretical framework would de-center and contextualize western ways of thinking and knowing, and intervene in projects which seek to know, essentialize, and represent bodies of color by unearthing the historical, colonial, and racial relations that have desired the “Other” as a category of analysis. This paper presents important theoretical positions on epistemology, and contributes highly to critical theory and practice.},

The article explores the investment of this imagery with the Stoic notion of excess (luxury) and its impact on defining the Christian concept of sin as received and further developed by Dante and Boccaccio. So far, scholarly discussion has tended to focus on the Homeric overcoat of pietas and its opposite furor, which under the influence of Posidonius (135–51 BCE), came to be associated with traditional Roman virtues. Instead, I here focus on Erictho (Lucan) and Tisiphone (Statius) as symbols of sinful temptation and effeminizing excess (luxury), typically gripping its victims through the eyes. In response to these infernal female figures, Dante and Boccaccio attributed epic proportions to ethical life, turning it into a canvas on which they debated the Christian moral code of their times. The gendered principles underpinning sinful excess in both pagan and Christian authors are discussed, alongside the role of poetry in counter-proposing the figures of Piety and Clemency.},

In dialogue with skeptical intellectual trends, particularly Montaigne’s brand of Pyrrhonism, Góngora’s elliptical, anamorphic poetics renders language nearly indecipherable. Underlying its monstrous appearance, however, is an elegant symmetry and intelligibility, a circumstance analogous to the cosmic incoherency of the Ptolemaic and Copernican systems resolved by Kepler’s elliptical planetary orbits. Similarly, Polyphemus’s monocular view distorts his picture of the world, a narcissistic condition exposed by the anamorphic pictorial practice Góngora translates into verse. Góngora’s poem enacts, both in plot and method, a process of desengaño in which a literary figuration becomes disfigured, creating a new figural expression of the world and exposing the contingent nature of perception and interpretation.},

  abstract = {Greek tragedy is easily one of the most dynamic fields in Classics. In addition to its perennial appeal and popularity among diverse audiences, every few years its study is reinvented and redefined as scholars and students apply new theories and critical lenses, many of which stem from contemporary concerns. In the last 50 years, for example, a rich body of work began to explore the manifold intersections between Greek tragedy and Athenian ritual and social practices, in line with rising interest in the social sciences. Over the past few decades scholars have slowly but steadily turned their gaze towards the performance and staging of tragedy and ancient Greek drama. To a large degree this interest has been fuelled by contemporary performance practice and experience, particularly as productions and adaptations of ancient plays have proliferated across the globe. Whereas the scholarship on the myriad ways in which Greek tragedy has been adapted and performed across the globe is itself a growing subfield deserving of its own profile, my focus here is on recent scholarly and creative work produced in the last ten years that illuminates Athenian performance practices. As I illustrate, we have come a long way since the seminal works of N.C. Hourmouziades (               Production and Imagination in Euripides: Form and Function of the Scenic Space               [1965]) and O. Taplin (               The Stagecraft of Aeschylus: the Dramatic Use of Exits and Entrances in Greek Tragedy               [1977]), who were among the first to draw attention to tragedy as a performed art.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Humanistic disciplines have family resemblances rather than a simple shared common aim or method, and, like literal family resemblances, these have an explanation that comes from their historical relationships to one another. Philosophy, in particular, is closely connected to the sciences it has spun off over the centuries, but remains distinct from them, because normative inquiry uses methods different from those of any contemporary science. But much philosophical inquiry, like much humanistic work, is also idiographic rather than nomothetic; it focuses our attention on particular things, rather than seeking generalizations. The rewards of humanistic study are, therefore, as diverse as what we can gain from paying attention to its diverse objects of study. In ethics and political philosophy, in particular, we learn from studying particular episodes in which we discover the significance of certain values by recognizing what is wrong in societies in which they are not respected.},

Most approaches to topic model inference have been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient algorithms exist that approximate this objective, but they have no provable guarantees. Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and not robust to violations of model assumptions. In this paper we present an algorithm for topic model inference that is both provable and practical. The algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations while running orders of magnitude faster.},

  abstract = {Traditional farming systems have attracted a lot of attention over the past decades as they have been recognized to supply an important component in the maintenance of the genetic diversity worldwide. A broad spectrum of traditionally managed crops has been studied to investigate how reproductive properties in combination with husbandry characteristics shape the genetic structure of the crops over time. However, traditional farms typically involve populations of small size whose genetic evolution is overwhelmed with statistic fluctuations inherent to the stochastic nature of the crossings. Hence there is generally no one-to-one mapping between crop properties and measured genotype data, and claims regarding crop properties on the basis of the observed genetic structure must be stated within a confidence level to be estimated by means of a dedicated statistical analysis. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive framework to carry out such statistical analyses. We illustrate the capabilities of our approach by applying it to crops of C. lanatus var. lanatus oleaginous type cultivated in Côte d׳Ivoire. While some properties such as the effective field size considerably evade the constraints from experimental data, others such as the mating system turn out to be characterized with a higher statistical significance. We discuss the importance of our approach for studies on traditionally cultivated crops in general.},

However, over the centuries, many inscriptions have been damaged to the point of illegibility, transported far from their original location and their date of writing is steeped in uncertainty. Here we present Ithaca, a deep neural network for the textual restoration, geographical attribution and chronological attribution of ancient Greek inscriptions. Ithaca is designed to assist and expand the historian’s workflow. The architecture of Ithaca focuses on collaboration, decision support and interpretability. While Ithaca alone achieves 62\% accuracy when restoring damaged texts, the use of Ithaca by historians improved their accuracy from 25\% to 72\%, confirming the synergistic effect of this research tool. Ithaca can attribute inscriptions to their original location with an accuracy of 71\% and can date them to less than 30\,years of their ground-truth ranges, redating key texts of Classical Athens and contributing to topical debates in ancient history. This research shows how models such as Ithaca can unlock the cooperative potential between artificial intelligence and historians, transformationally impacting the way that we study and write about one of the most important periods in human history.},

Dover has demonstrated that many of the stories of attacks on intellectuals rest on little more than flimsy speculation. Similarly there has been a reluctance to accept the historicity of the several restrictions on comedy recorded by scholiasts. Thus, for example, H. B. Mattingly has expressed doubts about Morychides' decree, and S. Halliwell has rejected Antimachus' decree as a fiction and has adopted an agnostic attitude towards Syracosius' decree. But one cannot sweep all the references aside as fallacious inferences. This short paper looks first at the evidence that Cleon initiated a legal action against Aristophanes (or possibly Callistratus) after the production of the               The Babylonians               , in the light of what the Old Oligarch wrote about curbs on comedians. Secondly, the historicity of Syracosius' decree will be tested by an attempt to define its nature and purpose in its political context. This exercise will show that circumstantial evidence adduced against the historicity of the decree has no compelling force.},

Through close attention to the Chorus's composition as a body that is both one and many at the same time, and by tracing their evolving position throughout the action of the drama and in their choral odes, I argue that they model a reflective and political orientation to judgment rooted in plurality, tradition, and innovation.},

  abstract = {The launching of Google Books and of Google Earth in 2004 could be considered a symbolic landmark for building memories. In this context, we consider that digital literatures are a very useful workbench for exploring the consequences of global digital circulation as a factual process but also as an imaginary storytelling. Literatures born digital can show how rituals of reading, formulas of production, and narratives are being modified in the twenty-first century. This article traverses a very large and diverse domain: digital literatures circulating in Spanish all over the world, not just those created in Spanish-speaking countries. The starting point is Ciberia, a repository of digital literature in Spanish, but other digital collections such as LitElat, IloveE-Poetry, Hermeneia, ELMCIP, and ELO are also covered. The authors use a post-Bourdieu methodology to study circulating digital literatures in Spanish as an emerging and dynamic field. By doing so, they show how these literatures give birth to new communities of reader-writers, reading differently and perhaps announcing how readers from the new generation are going to read.},

The concept of oneness plays a significant role in his major work Being and Event, as does the radical thesis that the subject is always the object of philosophy, also first introduced in these lectures. The idea of the one is important for Badiou as it is in a sense the foil for his signature metaphysical concept, the multiple, which references the disjunctive, multiple, nonunitary nature of reality: being consists of the set of cohesive, comprehensible entities, or individuated "ones." Through an analysis of the role played by the one in the history of western philosophy, illustrated in the writings of Plato, Descartes, and Kant, Badiou identifies its totalizing effects and the problems they create for a democratic politics"--},

This book reworks the concept of situated knowledges put forward over thirty years ago by American biologist and philosopher Donna Haraway in order to challenge the Enlightenment paradigm of objectivity in sciences by emphasising the role of the embodied and partial socio-cultural perspective of the scholar in the production of knowledge. Through carefully selected case studies of contemporary natural, cultural and technological performances, contributors to this volume show that the proposed approach requires new genealogies of traditional concepts, emerges from encounters with contemporary performative arts or contact zones and may potentially go beyond the human in order to include non-human ways of being in the world. It will be of great interest to students and scholars of performance studies, cultural studies, media studies and theatre studies"--},

The book is organized around equaliberty, a term coined by Balibar to connote the tension between the two ideals of modern democracy: equality (social rights and political representation) and liberty (the freedom citizens have to contest the social contract). He finds the tension between these different kinds of rights to be ingrained in the constitution of the modern nation-state and the contemporary welfare state. At the same time, he seeks to keep rights discourse open, eschewing natural entitlements in favor of a deterritorialized citizenship that could be expanded and invented anew in the age of globalization. Deeply engaged with other thinkers, including Arendt, Rancière, and Laclau, he posits a theory of the polity based on social relations. In Equaliberty Balibar brings both the continental and analytic philosophical traditions to bear on the conflicted relations between humanity and citizenship},

However, despite methodologically focused papers that discuss the limitations of mutual information scores and the importance of uncertainty estimates in corpus linguistic data, very few applied papers consider the implications of these observations for their analyses. This paper provides a methodologically focused, empirical case study of mutual information scores to examine the extent to which such concerns have implications for study design and the interpretation of results. The paper reports mutual information scores for 100 node words in general American English, and then compares the lists of strong collocates identified with those identified in four corpora representing narrower domains of American English. In so doing, it highlights the range of collocations observed and the relatively poor overlap between conventionally defined strong collocates in general English and those that are identified in narrow domains. The results are discussed in relation to their implications for research involving listing collocates, pedagogical targeting of collocates, and the use of collocation as a correlate of broader constructs such as proficiency. Suggestions are made for calculations that could be used in a test-retest approach to address the issues identified.},

I contest this inter pretation and argue that a more productive conception of flesh emerges when understood in terms of Heidegger's philosophy.

It also considers how the digital turn is reinvigorating textual analysis, by exploring the broader ecosystem, within which the digital text can now be studied, and which provides enriched contexts for understanding that are constantly shifting and expanding. Classical literature in the digital age has the potential to both challenge dominant modes of thinking about antiquity and disrupt traditional ways of doing research.},

  abstract = {This chapter tackles head-on the problem of the double agon in the play's second half, as Teucer and the Atreidae argue over Ajax's body, and interprets it as part of a strategy that emphasizes spectating and speaking back. Points of contact with the Iliad demonstrate this shift in perspective from the hero to those looking on, as rst Odysseus is installed as a spectator of Ajax's Achilles-like dialogue with Athena, Ajax's men articulate their concerns, and Tecmessa, though only a slave, speaks back like an Andromache. This process culminates in Teucer's defence in the agon, as Sophocles stages a battle of words not for Achilles' arms, but for Ajax's memory. In this the Chorus play a key role by turning to Odysseus, showing their progress from dependants to autonomous subjects in the agon and pre guring the role of the Athenian audience, as judges within a fully realized institutional arena.},

  abstract = {Unjust Readings: Against the New New Criticism" offers a theoretical and methodological defence of the use of digital humanities methods for literary interpretation. I argue that extant critiques of DH from Fish, Da, Eyers and others depend on an unexamined notion of the appropriate work of the humanities and, in particular, of literary interpretation. Their claim, that critics should simply "just read" obscures the manner in which literary interpretation is never simply 'just reading.' I argue that DH not only raises interpretive possibilities that would be impossible without digital tools but also foregrounds the methodological choices and theoretical paradigms that so often are unstated, or implicit, in traditional humanities work. Inherent to the interpretive act that moves between the digital and the humanities is a need to state how the critic works between the two, thereby making the interpretive frame explicit. I then demonstrate a number of examples, from my research and the work of others, that demonstrate this productive capacity of DH in order to further refute that critics should simply 'just read' the texts.},

  abstract = {Non-destructive analysis of 1,578 paper specimens made between the fourteenth and the nineteenth centuries was undertaken in an effort to better understand changes in paper composition over time and how these variations might affect paper stability during long term natural ageing. Gelatine content and colour were determined using UV/Vis/NIR spectrometry. Residual metals were measured using XRF. These components included potassium and sulfur as elements indicative of alum concentration; iron as a typical paper contaminant; and calcium, which is often associated with compounds such as calcium carbonate that can serve as alkaline reserves. The research demonstrated that papers that are lighter in colour (closer to white) are associated with higher levels of gelatine and calcium, and lower levels of iron. The survey also showed significant decreases in gelatine and calcium concentration over time with the largest differences coinciding with the rise of printing around 1500. The drop in pH over the centuries observed by other researchers is explained by the decreases in these two components rather than by a rise in alum concentration, which remained fairly stable. The craftsmanship of the specimens was evaluated using materials and workmanship ratings which showed better quality paper associated with higher gelatine and calcium concentrations and colour closer to white. Poorer quality papers were associated with higher iron levels and greater thickness.},

DanteSources allows users to retrieve and visualize the list and the distribution of Dante's primary sources that have been identified by recent commentaries of five of Dante’s minor works (i.e. Vita nova, De vulgari eloquentia, Convivio, De Monarchia, and Rime). The digital library is based on a formal ontology expressed in Resource Description Framework Schema (RDFS) language. Based on the DanteSources experience, the HDN project aims to formally represent the primary sources of the Divine Comedy whose identification is based on several commentaries included in the Dartmouth Dante Project corpus. To reach this goal, we restructured and extended the DanteSources ontology to provide a wider and more complete representation of the knowledge concerning the primary sources of the Comedy. In this article, we present the result of this effort, i.e. the HDN ontology. The ontology is expressed in OWL and has as reference ontologies the CIDOC CRM and its extension FRBRoo, including its in-progress reformulation LRMoo. We also briefly describe the semi-automatic tool that will be used by the scholars to populate the ontology.},

For in the course of his analysis of justice, or as a result of it, Hesiod praises also the life of autonomous understanding, the life that appears to be the poet’s own. In crucial ways, then, Hesiod explores the chief themes of what was to become political philosophy, and for this reason, among others, he deserves the attention of all those who are also concerned with it.},

In Vergil's telling, Aeneas' heroic journey not only gave Romans and Italians a thrilling origin story, it established many of the fundamental themes that shape human existence--the role of duty and self-sacrifice, the place of love and passion in human life, the relationship between art and violence, the tension between immigrant and indigenous people, and the way new foundations are so often built upon the wreckage of those who came before .." -- Inside jacket},

Scholars have worked on identifying writers’ stylistic differences in an attempt to distinguish genuine texts from fakes, and to attribute an author to previously anonymous works. Increasing computing power allows the derivation of more complex features, giving us new information about each author’s linguistic signature and writing style. Our system is able to accurately predict the author of a complete anonymous work, as well as many text fragments that currently have contested authorship. We experimented with using semantic and lexical features, and explored both discriminative and generative classification algorithms. Our highest-performing system achieved an attribution accuracy of 85.7\%.},

  abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

The volume includes twenty-one notes and fragments by Benjamin along with passages from all of the contemporaneous texts to which his essay refers. Readers thus encounter for the first time in English provocative arguments about law and violence advanced by Hermann Cohen, Kurt Hiller, Erich Unger, and Emil Lederer. A new translation of selections from Georges Sorel's Reflections on Violence further illuminates Benjamin's critical program. The volume also includes, for the first time in any language, a bibliography Benjamin drafted for the expansion of the essay and the development of a corresponding philosophy of law. An extensive introduction and afterword provide additional context. With its challenging argument concerning violence, law, and justice-which addresses such topical matters as police violence, the death penalty, and the ambiguous force of religion-Benjamin's work is as important today as it was upon its publication in Weimar Germany a century ago"--},

The essay posits that the humanities are flourishing in a variety of public spaces, where voices outside the academy are more effectively questioning what it means to commemorate the past and build in community and meaning through that process. But even with such work thriving, the humanities face challenges. Some of those challenges are related to definitional and communications issues in and between both the academic and public sectors. Other challenges are related to access and allocation of resources. While this essay does not pretend to have “answers “ to these perennial issues, it suggests that both the academy and the public might benefit from and create more lasting and relevant impact from bridge-building that marries the expertise and knowledge from both communities.},

The goal was to retrieve the informational needs of all these different sources in order to build a common data model for European Poetry (EP). Thus, by implementing a reverse engineering method, we have created the Domain Model for EP, which is an important breakthrough for making existent poetry resources interoperable. The lack of a uniform academic approach to analyse and classify poetic manifestations, the divergence of theories when comparing poetry schools from different languages and periods is some of the factors that hinder the modelling process. In this paper, we will present some of the challenges we encountered while conceptualizing the information relevant to poetic analysis and how we have worked around them. Some elements of the ontology will be presented to illustrate our modelling strategies.},

Shakespeare uses ballads to establish a privileged relationship between Ophelia and the audience and to stage a gender-based critique of Elsinore. In conversation with Hamlet's elitism, Ophelia's ballads demonstrate that Shakespeare simultaneously delegitimizes popular performance and embraces its theatrical possibilities.},

Neoptolemus has the task of bringing about the necessary reconciliation, forcing him to search for a concept of justice that can incorporate the two factions. His failure makes necessary the appearance of Heracles, whose divinity succeeds where humans failed.

Developing an innovative approach to dramatic form as a mode of philosophical thought, Billings recasts early Greek intellectual history as a conversation across types of discourses and demonstrates the significance of dramatic reflections on widely-shared conceptual questions. He integrates evidence from tragedy, comedy, and satyr play into the development of early Greek philosophy in order to place poetry at the center of Greek thought. He thus offers a substantially new history and map of classical intellectual culture: drama, on his view, appears as our best source for understanding the thought of the fifth century, while at the same time revealing significant tensions and anxieties in the development of philosophy. At the heart of the book is a novel approach to the philosophical qualities of drama. Though dramatists and their works have been considered philosophical in a variety of ways going back to antiquity, scholarly approaches have consistently taken "literature" and "philosophy" as defined categories, tracing more or less direct connections between one and the other. On the contrary, Billings argues that neither "literature" nor "philosophy" were available as stable categories in the fifth century. Rather he describes the way that drama treats issues that would come to be called philosophical, without relying on assumptions concerning what constitutes philosophical method or literary form. Drama develops a kind of method that allows it to pose and pursue conceptual questions in dramatic form which Billings describes as the "philosophical poetics" of drama"--},

The aim is to enable declarative models of textual analysis, with the particular goals of analyzing syntactic structure, historical orthographies, text-reuse, and of creating machine-actionable (but technologically agnostic) critical apparatus. This data-model is independent of technology, but currently implmented through an archive of xml texts and plain-text tabular data, and served as rdf in .ttl format.},

CITE stands for “Collections, Indices, Texts, and Extensions”, and the acronym invokes the long history of citation as the basis for scholarly publication. Each of the four parts of CITE is based on abstract data models. Two parallel standards for citation identify data that implement those models: the CTS URN, for identifying texts and passages of text, and the CITE2 URN for identifying other data. Both of these URN citation schemes capture the necessary semantics of the data they identify, in context. In this paper we will describe the theoretical foundations of CITE, explain CTS and CITE2 URNs, describe the current state of the models for scholarly data that CITE defines, and introduce the current data formats, code libraries, utilities, and end-user applications that implement CITE.},

  abstract = {Scholars have long grappled with the nature of Heracles’ νόσος and his consequent feminization in Sophocles’               Women of Trachis               (=               Trachiniae               ). Despite being triggered by a poisonous garment, which acts by means of magic incantation, the evolution of Heracles’ symptoms is described as a clinical case. Yet, making sense of his feminization from a scientific perspective has proven hard. In this paper, I investigate the symptoms experienced by Heracles, which Sophocles generically refers to as νόσος. The first part focusses on Sophocles’ description of               erôs               as a disease in               Trachiniae               . I then move on to dividing Heracles’ symptoms into two categories, which I will call νόσος               1               and νόσος               2               . The erotic passion for Iole which Heracles naturally experiences in the first part of the tragedy will be denoted by νόσος               1               , whereas νόσος               2               will refer to the magic-induced symptoms from which he suffers in the second and final part. In the final section of the paper I will seek to provide a scientific explanation for νόσος               2               and, ultimately, to describe the medical reasons behind Heracles’ feminization.},

The present article takes visualisation of the result of collation software as point of departure, examining several visualisations of collation output that contains a wealth of information about textual variance.

The book's central claim is that in his life-long engagement with embodiment Beckett invites us to disarticulate the concept of agency from intentionality and to redistribute it onto a space shaped by what Merleau-Ponty calls the body-subject. Beckett's prose reimagines agency as such a spatial phenomenon—irreducible to individual will and untethered from old mind-matter dichotomies. In developing this idea, Dennis reinvigorates the debate on agency in contemporary criticism by shifting the focus from questions of will, desire, and intention to figures of embodiment and lived space.},

Today, Kalmykia is situated in the territory that was once the Golden Horde, founded by the son of Genghis Khan, Juchi. Although their famed West-Wing khanates and cities have long since disappeared under the sands of the Great Eurasian Steppe, the Kalmyks have witnessed, memorized, and orally transmitted some of the most transformative developments, both victorious and tragic, in the history of civilizations. A tribute to the protectors of the mythical country Bumba, Jangar reflects the hopes and aspirations of the Kalmyk people, their centuries-long struggle for their cultural existence. This new English translation is more than a tribute to the artistic creativity and imagination of the Kalmykian people-it is also an important step in their struggle for cultural survival. It was only after centuries of oral transmission that the songs and stories surrounding Jangar were written down. When the first translation, into Russian, finally appeared, Stalin had the entire Kalmyk population deported to Siberia and ordered that their national literature be eliminated from the published world. This Soviet repression has had enormous consequences for world literature, silencing nomadic voices and keeping hidden their distinctive contributions. Making Jangar available in English is a landmark event, bringing a lost classic to the world's attention and restoring the voices of an almost erased tradition at the heart of the history of Eurasia"--},

The practice of combing through ancient historiography and excerpting passages pertaining to specific colonies was evidently familiar to the ancients. Livy, one of Alciato’s main sources for Roman colonization during the Republican period, seems to have crafted his narrative with keen awareness that his readers viewed his text in precisely this way.},

Since Sophocles follows in many important points the more complex version of the Little Iliad, he emphasizes the role of Athena, gives a new mea ing to Calchas' prophecy and places the Ajax' story in two following days,fromthe madness' beginning to the death.},

For the best part of a century, close reading has grounded literary studies in the university, structuring assessment, teaching, employment, and publication. A basic proficiency in close reading has long been a professional obligation for faculty members and a course requirement for students. It makes sense, then, that Caroline Levine's               Forms               begins with a description of our method in action. A reader is settling down to work with a copy of               Jane Eyre.               She has a lengthy education behind her and a wealth of interpretive techniques for the book in front of her. Still, one thing is certain: our critic will broach the forms of the novel by drawing from “close reading methods” while using “historical research methods to analyze sociopolitical experience.” “But,” Caroline Levine asks, “would our critic be right to distinguish between the               formal               and the               social?”               (1).},

  abstract = {"Remember the Hand studies a body of articulate manuscript books from the Christian monasteries of northern Iberia in the tenth and eleventh centuries. These exceptional, richly illuminated codices have in common an urgent sense of scribal presence-scribes name themselves, describe themselves, even paint their own portraits. While marginal notes, even biographical ones, are a common feature of medieval manuscripts, rarely do scribes make themselves so fully known. These writers address the reader directly, asking for prayers of intercession and sharing of themselves. They ask the reader to join them in not only acknowledging the labor of writing but also in theorizing it through analogy to agricultural work or textile production, tending a garden of knowledge, weaving a text out of words. By mining this corpus of articulate codices (known to a school of Iberian codicologists, but virtually unstudied outside that community), Catherine Brown recovers these scribes' understanding of reading as a powerful, intimate encounter between many parties-authors and their text, scribes and their pen, patrons and their art-object, readers and the words and images before their eyes-all mediated by the material object known as the book. By rendering that mediation conspicuous and reminding us of the labor that necessarily precedes that mediation, the scribes reach out to us across time with a simple but profound directive: Remember the hand. Remember the Hand is available from the publisher on an open-access basis"--},

Sometimes grouped under the umbrella term ‘cognitive sciences’, diverse disciplines such as neuroscience, psychology, philosophy, computer science, and linguistics have all made major contributions to our understanding of the human mind and brain; and the large number of popular science books published in this area show that this can be an engrossing topic for the layperson as much as for experts. In this article we want to explore, at a rather general and non-technical level, how this focus on matters of cognition can help us think about an aspect of Greek tragedy.},

This article examines three of her plays from the late eighties and early nineties, using both Freudian and performance theories, in order to show how these works document the range of emotions in post Dirty War Argentina and, at the same time, postulate ways of coping with the memories of those years. Beyond traditional memory-theater, these plays demonstrate the trauma of remembering by highlighting different phases in the memory process and by conceptualizing stages in the grief of a traumatized nation. In each play, Gambaro establishes a metaphor of thwarted or frustrated travel to question how much psychological progress Argentines and their nation have made since the Dirty War (1976-83).},

With its arousing language, its gripping descriptions, and its compelling argument, it traverses seamlessly between the psychological and the structural, between alienation and domination. Yet, it passes lightly over the connecting tissue, the social processes that are the entry point for ethnography. In this essay, the author sketches Fanon’s theory of decolonization, how it shaped one of his ethnographies of postcolonial Zambia, and ends with reflections on its significance today.},

I discuss conversation-based classroom activities drawn from recent Latin pedagogical literature and demonstrate how they can be adapted to chat. A conclusion argues for deeper interdisciplinary collaboration between classics and computer science as a way to leverage recent innovations while ensuring that technologies are “fine-tuned” to teaching expectations within the field.},

  abstract = {This chapter examines how the critically acclaimed video game Hades (Supergiant Games, 2020) adapts and interprets the classical mythic tradition for a contemporary audience. After contextualising Hades as a game, a narrative, and a cultural artefact, I examine several specific textual moments in the game’s narrative: partial allusions to the stories of Theseus and Ariadne and Callisto and Zeus, the rationalised aetiology of Orphic Zagreus, and the fragmented and reshaped relationship between Zeus and Demeter around Persephone’s “abduction”. These episodes show the designers connecting textual moments from the Greek mythic storyworld to the game’s story by threads of potentiality that lead the player in either direction: towards the game or towards the myths. These connections allow references to myth to expand the storyworld of the game while also allowing the designers the freedom to reshape aspects of the myth to suit the concerns and interests of their contemporary audience.},

By personifying these wild landscapes, the hymn allows for a reading in which the exploitation of the earth is called into question. Drawing on theoretical paradigms from ecocriticism, this article proposes an understanding of place in the hymn centered on concepts of negotiation, power, and care. Delos and Telphousa, along with the silent sites of Thebes and Onchestos, become recognized sacred places in the hymn through a complex process of negotiation between gods, humans, and the personified landscapes themselves.},

  abstract = {This study sets out to reveal the groundbreaking use of monody in the late plays of Euripides: in his hands, it is shaped into a potent and flexible instrument for representing emotion and establishing new narrative and thematic structures. Engaging with the current scholarly debate on music, affect, and characterization in Greek tragedy, I examine the role that monody plays in the musical design of four plays of Euripides, all produced in the last decade of his career: Ion, Iphigenia in Tauris, Phoenician Women, and Orestes. These plays are marked by the increased presence of actors’ song in proportion to choral song. The lyric voice of the individual takes on an unprecedented prominence with far-reaching implications for the structure and impact of each play. The monodies of Euripides are a true dramatic innovation: in addition to creating an effect of heightened emotion, monody is used to develop character and shape plot.       In Ion, Iphigenia in Tauris, Phoenician Women, and Orestes, Euripides uncouples monody’s traditional and exclusive connection with lament. In contrast to the work of Aeschylus and Sophocles, where actors’ song is always connected with grief and pain, in these four plays monody conveys varied moods and states of mind. Monody expresses joy, hope, anxiety, bewilderment, accusation, and deliberation. Often, and simultaneously, it moves forward narrative exposition. The scope and dramatic function of monody grows and changes: passages of actors’ lyric become longer, more metrically complex, more detached from the other characters onstage, and more intensely focused on the internal experience of the singer. In the four plays under discussion we see a steadily increasing refinement and expansion of the form, a development that rests upon the changes in the style and function of contemporary music in the late fifth century.         By 415 B.C., many formal features of tragedy had become highly conventionalized, and determined a set of expectations in the contemporary audience. Reacting against this tradition, Euripides successively redefines monody: each song takes over a traditional Bauform of tragedy, and builds upon it. The playwright uses the paired monodies of Ion to pose a conflict of ideas that might otherwise be conveyed through an agon. In Iphigenia in Tauris the heroine’s crisis and its resolution are presented in lyrics, rather than as a deliberative rhesis. In Phoenician Women, Antigone, Jocasta, and Oedipus replace the Chorus in lamenting the fall of the royal house. Finally, the Phrygian slave in Orestes sings a monody explicitly marked as a messenger speech that inverts the conventions of the form to raise questions about objectivity and truth in a disordered world.        In examining these four plays, I hope to show some of the various potentials of this new Euripidean music as a major structural element in tragic drama, insofar as it can heighten emphasis, allow for the development of emotional states both subtle and extreme, reveal and deepen character, and mirror thematic movements. Euripides establishes monody as a dramatic form of considerable versatility and power. The poetry is charged with increased affect and expressivity; at the same time it articulates a new self-consciousness about the reciprocal capacities of form and content to shape one another. Here we may discern the shift of sensibility in Euripides’ late work, which proceeds pari passu with an apparent loosening of structural demands, or what one with equal justice might recognize as an increase in degrees of freedom. As the playwright repeatedly reconfigures the relationship between form and content, the range of what can happen onstage, of what can be said and sung, expands.},

Contributing to the current scholarly debate on music, emotion, and characterization in Greek drama, this book presents a new vision for the role of monody in the musical design of Ion, Iphigenia among the Taurians, Phoenician Women, and Orestes.

A normalized version of the major collections of annotated texts was used to (i) train the baseline model Dithrax with randomly initialized character embeddings and (ii) fine-tune Trankit and four recent models pretrained on Ancient Greek texts, i.e., GreBERTa and PhilBERTa for morphosyntactic annotation and GreTA and PhilTa for lemmatization. A Bayesian analysis shows that Dithrax and Trankit annotate morphology practically equivalently, while syntax is best annotated by Trankit and lemmata by GreTa. The results of the experiment suggest that token embeddings are not sufficient to achieve high UAS and LAS scores unless they are coupled with a modeling strategy specifically designed to capture syntactic relationships. The dataset and best-performing models are made available online for reuse.},

Questions of climate justice and sustainable human futures have deepened fractured and contested histories of modernity in which the West/non-West division intersects with emergent distinctions between postcolonial and decolonial approaches. But none of these distinctions are absolute. By discussing the works of Déborah Danowski and Eduardo Viveiros de Castro, I seek to show how traditions of European and non-European thought remain entangled even as we seek, intellectually, to decolonize the world. In a connected world, the not-one-ness of humanity acts as a ground for dissension within the humanities but not for any absolute differences.},

While previous work has focused on conversation disentanglement in IRC chatroom dialogues, movies and TV shows provide a space for studying complex pragmatic patterns of floor and topic change in face-to-face multiparty interactions. In this work, we draw on theoretical research in sociolinguistics, sociology, and film studies to operationalize a conversational thread (including the notion of a floor change) in dramatic texts, and use that definition to annotate a dataset of 10,033 dialogue turns (comprising 2,209 threads) from 831 movies. We compare the performance of several disentanglement models on this dramatic dataset, and apply the best-performing model to disentangle 808 movies. We see that, contrary to expectation, average thread lengths do not decrease significantly over the past 40 years, and characters portrayed by actors who are women, while underrepresented, initiate more new conversational threads relative to their speaking time.},

  abstract = {In Glas , Derrida focuses his attention on a question regarding the family, on the unintelligibility of familial love for which Hegel makes Antigone representative. The account of the emergence of self-consciousness in the family differs in several crucial ways from the standard account of how Hegelian self-consciousness is constituted in the master- slave dialectic. Most notably, the achievement of self-consciousness through familial love involves no risk of life, no struggle to the death, no conflict. While Derrida refrains from interrogating the relation between the master- slave dialectic and sexual difference directly, he interrogates the peaceful recognition that Hegel says occurs between Polynices as brother and Antigone as sister. I explore the silences that punctuate Derrida's discussion of Antigone, especially his silence on Hegel's twofold elision of the master-slave dialectic with the husband-wife relation, and of Antigone with the figure of the wife. By symbolically marrying her off, Hegel subordinates Antigone to a symbolic husband.},

  abstract = {In 1314, the Oxford Dominican monk Nicholas Trevet was commissioned to write a commentary on Seneca’s tragedies. Trevet’s interpretation of character and plot in Seneca’s Medea differs in many ways from 21st-century classical scholars. Because Trevet relied on a single manuscript from the A tradition, he and his readers did not have access to a Senecan Medea who asks Jason whether he ‘recognizes his wife’ before departing Corinth in a flying chariot drawn by serpents because the last nineteen lines of the play did not exist in A. Trevet did not know a Medea who told her Nurse that she ‘would become’ Medea. It is Trevet’s Medea, and not Jason, who is being pursued by Pelias’s son Acastus. For Trevet, Jason’s alliance with Creon’s daughter Creusa is calculated not to protect himself and his sons from an angry and dangerous Acastus, but in order to save Medea’s life. Furthermore, the theme of Medea as Jason’s saviour, and this act of salvation itself as the cause of crime, informs Trevet’s reading (and misreading) of important passages. Finally, when Medea argues back and forth with herself, Trevet attributes Medea’s regard for her sons as ‘not mine’ to her loss of power over them because of her exile from Corinth, without any mention that the sons might now belong to Jason’s new wife Creusa. These are all subtle interpretations that cumulatively form a unique ‘reading’ of Seneca’s Medea offered by the very first commentator on all of Seneca’s plays, seven hundred years ago.},

Furthermore, based on the role that Schütz attributes on trust in the economy of common sense, we try to analyze the passage from the time of heroes to the time of men. This passage commences during Cervantes’ times and he captures it in the struggle between a vulgar peasant and an aristocrat chevalier. The brilliant victory of Sancho Pancha augurs the pre-eminence of the political ideas of modern era.},

Reported direct speech is revealed to be considerably restrained, even when it occurs in highly emotional contexts. This restraint is interesting, given the prevalence of non-linguistic cries in tragedy, and it is brought into particular relief by comparison with the descriptions of violent utterances that often precede or follow sections of direct speech. There is a discernible, though inconsistent, trend towards the loosening of this restraint in later Euripides.},

Although autochthony in classical Athens has been studied extensively, the methodology of viewing the myth as a representation of a ritual and performative act has not been widely considered. This paper reflects upon autochthony from the angle of its ceremonial (re)presentation, considering how iconography helped shape a concrete and specific understanding of Athenian civic identity, including familial ties with the gods and eponymous ancestors. By situating fifth-century visual representations in vase painting as the most effective conduit for what autochthony meant, we can better understand its power as a visual action that replicates a ritual gift.},

Assassin’s Creed Odyssey is used as a case study to better understand the relationship between game design and the simulation of cultural heritage. By looking at fan-made trailers, as well as gameplay, paratexts and player-generated content, this article explores how ‘technocultural mashups’ enable players to participate in a networked historical imaginary.},

  abstract = {This article explores depictions and perceptions of Helen’s relations with the nonhuman world. Drawing on the insights of posthumanism, new materialisms, and affect theory for interpretative assistance, it argues that Helen, animals, natural entities, and material things are interconnected in bundles of intra-actions and trans-corporeal entanglements, which make Helen’s embodied, emotional expe­ rience vividly perceptible to the audience. Three things are exemplary in this regard: the “lovely virgin streams” (καλλιπάρθενοι ῥοαί, 1) of the Nile, whose features merge with Helen’s physical and moral qualities; the “egg” (τεῦχος νεοσσῶν λευκὸν, 256), which materializes her feeling of being a “monstrosity” (τέρας, 255); and the “statue” (ἄγαλμα, 262), which Helen compares to herself to bewail her beauty. Thus, by reacting to the Leitmotiv of the eidōlon (“phantom”) and highlighting the protean atmosphere of the Egyptian setting, this article aims to show that reading the Helen with a focus on the entanglements of the human and nonhuman allows us to shed new light on the theme of doubling, indeterminacy, and multiplicity which underlies the play.},

Following a general Introduction, Section 2 provides an overview of the historical principles by which pitch accent and melody are coordinated in the ancient musical documents, and considers how these principles would apply in the context of tragedy’s antistrophic song. Section 3 presents the results of a computational study of pitch accent responsion across all the extant lyrics of Aeschylus, finding the overall degree of responsion to be statistically significant compared to prose and verse control groups. In Section 4, I demonstrate how the melodic traces preserved in pitch accent patterns can be meaningfully related to the lyrics they accompany, using an example from the Kommos of Libation Bearers (434-43).},

  abstract = {In the original performance of Sophocles’ Trachiniae, song and dance were essential in communicating dramatic theme and character. Tragic choreia is structurally defined by paired stanzas: the antistrophe repeats the melody of the strophe but reverses its direction of dance. In Trachiniae, this antistrophic structure becomes thematic, representing the fateful bond between Deianeira and Heracles and the resulting narrative repetitions/ reversals. Digital analysis of pitch accents reveals that this musical metaphor was reinforced melodically through the development of a “shimmering” circumflex motif, culminating in Heracles’ melismatic monody. Through this musical framing, Sophocles situates his tragedy in relation to other genres (epic, paean) and to musical developments in the fifth century.},

  abstract = {When Sophocles wrote Electra's story, he gave her a sister, Chrysothemis. In their two scenes together, the sisters warn, entreat, cajole, insult, spar with, and proclaim affection for each other. While Electra maintains her public mourning for their father Agamemnon, Chrysothemis chooses not to openly defy his murderers, Aegisthus and their mother Clytemnestra, believing that resistance that accomplishes nothing is futile. Time has not been kind to this more pragmatic sister. In English-language criticism, she has acquired her own epithet, ‘timid’; her femininity has been dismissed as vacuous and her morality as driven by material self-interest. For many critics, she is a shallow and conventional figure whose main purpose is to act as a foil to the exceptional Electra. Since the pairing of a ‘stronger’ and a ‘weaker’ sister recurs in the depiction of Antigone and Ismene in Sophocles’               Antigone               , this portrait of two contrasting sisters has been recognised since antiquity as distinctively Sophoclean, and the corresponding reduction of the sister–sister bond to a template has frequently precluded deeper examination of this relationship in both plays.},

Such metric patterns were based on so-called syllabic quantity, that is, on the length of the involved syllables, and there is substantial evidence suggesting that certain authors had a preference for certain metric patterns over others. In this research we investigate the possibility to employ syllabic quantity as a base for deriving rhythmic features for the task of computational authorship attribution of Latin prose texts. We test the impact of these features on the authorship attribution task when combined with other topic-agnostic features. Our experiments, carried out on three different datasets using support vector machines (SVMs) show that rhythmic features based on syllabic quantity are beneficial in discriminating among Latin prose authors.},

In line with a long tradition of Antigones, her play appropriates the tragedy of Sophocles and reelaborates fragments taken from different texts by Marguerite Yourcenar, William Shakespeare, Rubén Darío, and from the last public speech made by Juan Domingo Perón. This broad panorama of textual dialogues is duly examined, but an analysis is also offered between Antígona furiosa and Leopoldo Marechal’s Antígona Vélez (1951). The aim here is to compare the mythical interpretation given to two key periods in the history of Argentina in the 20th century: Perón’s first presidency (1945-1955), and the terrorism carried out by the State during what was known as “El Proceso” (1976-1983). This study seeks to understand Gambaro’s theater as an artifact of memory, to point out the close relationship between her literature and the cultural, social and political world in which she moved in Argentina, as well as to highlight the central role of rewriting in this particular play.},

By making multiple intuitive representations readily available for experimentation, we facilitate rigorous representation robustness checks in graph learning, graph mining, and network analysis, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of specific representations. Leveraging the data released in Hyperbard, we demonstrate that many solutions to popular graph mining problems are highly dependent on the representation choice, thus calling current graph curation practices into question.

  abstract = {The Inscriptions of Israel/Palestine project is an online corpus of over four thousand inscriptions from Israel and Palestine, written in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and Aramaic, dating roughly from the Persian Period to the Arab Conquest. The source les with inscription text and metadata are encoded using EpiDoc, a TEI customization widely used by epigraphers. As the project prepared to deposit its XML les in an institutional repository, it transformed them into a locally developed robust archival format. This paper evaluates these decisions against the FAIR metrics, using IIP as a test case. This allows us to suggest improvements for our own archival encoding as well as to see where EpiDoc and TEI enhance FAIRness and where they could provide more support. Finally, we suggest some ways to use FAIR metrics that are more amenable to TEI documents and corpora.},

  abstract = {Foucault’s theory of disciplinary power and Bourdieu’s theory of symbolic power are among the most innovative attempts in recent social thought to come to terms with the increasingly elusive character of power in modern society. Both theories are based on critiques of subject-centered analyses of power and offer original accounts of modern social institutions. But Foucault’s critique of the subject is so radical that it makes it impossible to identify any determinate social location of the exercise of power or of resistance to its operations. Bourdieu’s theory of practice in terms of the symbolically mediated interaction between the habitus and social structure avoids these problems by connecting relations of domination both to identifiable social agents and to the institutions of the modern state. However, Bourdieu’s strategic model of social action remains too narrow to allow for the possibility of autonomous agency and an emancipatory political praxis. The theory of symbolic power must be supplemented by a normative conception of practical reason if its emancipatory potential is to be realized.},

This paper investigates and evaluates the range of possible data structures for text sequences. The ADT interface to the text sequence component of a text editor is examined. Six common sequence data structures (array, gap, list, line pointers, xed size bu ers and piece tables) are examined and then a general model of sequence data structures that encompasses all six structures is presented. The piece table method is explained in detail and its advantages are presented. The design space of sequence data structures is examined and several variations on the ones listed above are presented. These sequence data structures are compared experimentally and evaluated based on a number of criteria. The experimental comparison is done by implementing each data structure in an editing simulator and testing it using a synthetic load of many thousands of edits. We also report on experiments on the senstivity of the results to variations in the parameters used to generate the synthetic editing load.},

In this paper, I demonstrate how Treviño Orta’s play presents a uniquely Latine Antigone-story through its investigation into the realities of living and dead Chicane and Latine bodies. Woman on Fire’s emphasis on bodily physicality and how such mechanisms affect Latine experience situates the drama both among and away from the numerous Latin American adaptations of Sophocles’ Antigone noted and studied by scholars. While the play’s focus on the crisis surrounding the Latin American dead and disappeared connects Woman on Fire to that greater tradition, both its exploration of an “Antigone” who refuses to participate in an available burial as well as its use of the body to interpret the complexities of Latine identity and experience breaks new ground in the reception of the Antigone-story.},

The papyrus markings and associated commentary offer clues to the melodisation of Greek poetry, performance effects in choral song, the nature of dochmiac rhythm, and the kind of dance movements that might have accompanied vigorous passages in tragic lyric.},

It can be appreciated today as never before, thanks to the recent discovery of ancient manuscripts buried for some two millennia in the sands of Egypt. This fresh edition of Stesichorus' poems presents the first full-scale analysis of all his surviving works. The detailed introduction and commentary investigate a wide range of key issues, such as Stesichorus' imagery and style, his narrative technique, and his mythological innovations. The controversial question of how Stesichorus' poems were originally performed receives careful scrutiny; particular attention is paid to the fascinating story of the transmission, disappearance, and recovery of his work. A translation integrated with the commentary renders this book accessible to all readers with an interest in early Greek poetry and its legacy. --},

In its foregrounding of the body in war and torture, it critiques the minimising of the body in questions of politics, offering a compelling account of the structure and phenomenology of violent domination. However, at the same time the text can be seen to shore up a mind/body dualism that has been associated with oppressive forms of gendering, racialisation and disablement. Divisive, powerful and elegant, the text has been central in the shaping of approaches to embodiment over the past 30 years. This special issue revisits Scarry’s text in the light of 30 years of scholarship on embodiment and the body. Its legacies and limits are exemplified through a series of articles that mobilise the arguments of The Body in Pain even as they push at the limits of the text.},

Para tanto, explora-se inicialmente o problema da emergencia da subjetividade iluminista no contexto da cultura grega como fenómeno agonístico e indica-se o nascimento da tradiçào iluminista a partir das obras de Hesíodo e Esquilo. Em seguida, discute-se a posiçâo da modernidade ilustrada desde a perspectiva kantiana. Desde entâo, elabora-se a crítica à concepçao iluminista a partir das ideias nucleares de Marx, Nietzsche e Freud. Nesta crítica destaca-se o papel central das relaçôes de produçao económicas, da vontade de poder e dos instintos na determinacão e na compreensão da subjetividade humana. O legado comum dessas tres filosofías magnas aponta para o desmantelamento da subjetividade iluminista e, assim, para urna compreensão da condicäo humana, situada no horizonte de urna nova racionalidade, na quai a razão deixa de ocupar o lugar principal. This paper searches for, in an introductory way, a path toward understanding the human condition from critical reading of the Western Enlightenment presented by Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. For this purpose, the paper initially explores the problem of emergence of Enlightenment subjectivity in the context of Greek culture as an agonistic phenomenon and indicates the birth of the Enlightenment tradition from the works of Hesiod and Aeschylus. Then the position of modernity illustrated from the Kantian perspective is discussed. After that, the paper elaborates a critique of the Enlightenment conception departing from the core ideas of Marx, Nietzsche and Freud. This critique highlights the central role of economic relations of production, the will to power and instincts in determining and understanding of human subjectivity. The common heritage of these three magna philosophies points to the dismantlement of Enlightenment subjectivity and thus to an understanding of the human condition, situated on the horizon of a new rationality, in which reason ceases to occupy main place.},

  abstract = {This essay argues that in order fully to appreciate the reorientation of Foucault‟s lecture courses from the 1980s around the concepts of “truth” and “subjectivity,” it is necessary to read closely his very first lecture course at the Collège de France, Lectures on the Will to Know (1970-1971), in which, for the first time, Foucault focuses on the event of truth itself, rather than on a discourse of truth within the social or human sciences. The lectures delineate the Aristotelian “morphology of knowledge” and “system of truth” that have dominated western thought, and, with Nietzsche, question its underlying assumptions. Specifically, they bring out a deeper, more complex phenomenon, identified as the “will to know,” which reveals the inextricable bond between truth, knowledge and power. Foucault‟s genealogy of truth reveals the historical and contingent conditions of emergence of a morphology of thought which presents itself as natural, necessary, and disinterested. In doing so, however, Foucault also leaves open the question of whether a different morphology, and a different subject of truth, might be possible – a question to which he returns in the 1980s.},

The catabatic coloring of the episode has been sometimes acknowledged, but never systematically studied. The assumption that Homer s audience recognized some clear allusions to the tales of heroic descents to Hades offers a number of possibilities for exploration. Not only are several passages shown to have deeper poetic meaning in this light, but Homers use of traditional themes and his aesthetic and ideological competition with other epic traditions are also illuminated by this case study.},

Dionysius’ criticisms of Thucydides’ anti-Athenian attitude ( Letter to Pompeius 3.15), and his apparently conflicting praise (On Thucydides 8.1) of Thucydides’ commitment to the truth can be reconciled if we take into account Dionysius’ concept of “truth,” his intended audience, and his rhetorical concept of historiography.},

As a form that makes room for conflict, violence, and desire, tragic literature has the capacity to engender a non-utopian, engaged political critique that is truer to experience and less vulnerable to disintegration or attack than most modes of polemic political critique. As a dialectic, morally flexible form, it is able to contain its own contradictions; and as a genre embroiled in emotion and trauma, it can speak to all sides wounded by conflict without moralizing. It is in the hero's direct encounter with and response to conflict and violence, what Raymond Williams calls “its experience, its comprehension, and its resolution,” that the essay locates tragedy's potential for serious political work. The essay takes Hebrew culture as its primary example.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are a potential substitute for human-generated data and knowledge resources. This substitution, however, can present a significant problem for the training data needed to develop future models if it leads to a reduction of human-generated content. In this work, we document a reduction in activity on Stack Overflow coinciding with the release of ChatGPT, a popular LLM. To test whether this reduction in activity is specific to the introduction of this LLM, we use counterfactuals involving similar humangenerated knowledge resources that should not be affected by the introduction of ChatGPT to such extent. Within 6 months of ChatGPT’s release, activity on Stack Overflow decreased by 25\% relative to its Russian and Chinese counterparts, where access to ChatGPT is limited, and to similar forums for mathematics, where ChatGPT is less capable. We interpret this estimate as a lower bound of the true impact of ChatGPT on Stack Overflow. The decline is larger for posts related to the most widely used programming languages. We find no significant change in post quality, measured by peer feedback, and observe similar decreases in content creation by more and less experienced users alike. Thus, LLMs are not only displacing duplicate, low-quality, or beginner-level content. Our findings suggest that the rapid adoption of LLMs reduces the production of public data needed to train them, with significant consequences.},

As it is able to cope with half a million of inputs it requires no feature selection and can process the frequency vector of all words of a text. We performed a number of experiments with texts from a German newspaper. With nearly perfect reliability the SVM was able to reject other authors and detected the target author in 60–80\% of the cases. In a second experiment we ignored nouns, verbs and adjectives and replaced them by grammatical tags and bigrams. This resulted in slightly reduced performance. Author detection with SVM on full word forms was remarkably robust even if the author wrote about different topics.},

These models, as this essay will argue, call for distinct modes of humanistic interpretation and explication that are related to but distinct from those that may have been used on the original source texts. While vector space models are analyzed using increasingly complicated quantitative methods and the explanation of their operation requires statistical sophistication, my emphasis on humanistic interpretation is quite intentional. This essay theorizes two major categories of vector space models, the document-term matrix and neural language models, to position these models as not merely descriptions of texts but inscriptive representational objects that perform interpretive work of their own in order to demonstrate the need for a multi-level hermeneutics in computational literary studies.},

Building on Jackie Murray’s compelling observations about the different ways that black skin color has been rendered in recent translations of the Odyssey, I will argue that the “racecraft” that led translators to code Eurybates as Black has also prevented us from reading the ways that Homer codes Odysseus as “black”—as different, younger, more handsome. Reading the Odyssey together with the Aethiopica restores the earlier poem’s own use of skin color to explore the instability of physical appearance as a secure marker of identity.},

While student numbers have grown in higher education, universities and colleges increasingly have encouraged students to opt for courses in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) or take programs in applied subjects like business and management. When tertiary learning has taken such a notably utilitarian turn, the humanities are judged to have lost their centrality. Willem B. Drees has no wish nostalgically to prioritize the humanities so as to retrieve some lost high culture. But he does urge us to adopt a clearer conception of the humanities as more than just practical vehicles for profit or education. He argues that these disciplines, while serving society, are also intrinsic to our humanity. His bold ideas about how to think with greater humanistic coherence mark this topical book out as unmissable reading for all those involved in academe, especially those in higher educational policy or leadership positions.},

We use nine different sets of literary texts (specifically, novels) written in seven different languages as a basis for this evaluation. The evaluation is performed as a downstream classification task, where segments of the novels need to be classified by subgenre or period of first publication. The classifier receives different numbers of features identified using different measures of distinctiveness. The main contribution of our paper is that we can show that across a wide variety of parameters, but especially when only a small number of features is used, (more recent) dispersion-based measures very often outperform other (more established) frequency-based measures by significant margins. Our findings support an emerging trend to consider dispersion as an important property of words in addition to frequency.},

  abstract = {Digital transformation entails new sources of economic information in the form of rich texts, which can provide a deeper understanding of banking sector developments. With textual data available and accessible in digital format, this paper develops three distinct indices based on a large corpus of economic news articles to forecast banking crises. The methodological approaches feature the identification of key topics within a large volume of texts. A Banking Crisis Lexicon Index and Sentiment Index are developed through analysing a vast number of economic articles to detect the evolution of banking sector discourse. Findings from Granger causality highlight leading indicator status of the Banking Crisis Lexicon Index, signalling a change in the banking crisis series four years in advance, accentuated by innovations from a VAR analysis using Cholesky decomposition, and substantiated by receiver operating characteristics with under the curve estimates suggesting robust predictive performance strength above 70\%, on a global scale, for developed economies and crisis countries. Serving as benchmark, the Sentiment Index constitutes a concurrent indicator, which moves in tandem with the crisis series, thereby providing more granular information on banking developments. A combined Banking Crisis Lexicon and Sentiment Index exhibits solid forecasting performance, which is comparable to the Banking Crisis Lexicon Index, yet with shorter lead time. In a robustness test, German-based indices outperform those based on English reporting in a predominantly German speaking region, highlighting the value of textual analysis in the vernacular. In reading between the lines, this paper contributes to the literature on quantitative analyses of textual data in constructing text-based banking crisis indicators to support a preemptive policy response.},

Spanish Civil War and Argentine dictatorship saw the birth of many Antigones seeking justice. Starting from the M. Zambrano and G. Gambaro’s creations, this work rehabilitates the speech and the incarnations of the Iberian and Ibero-american Antigone. On the one hand, Spanish philosopher María Zambrano never came out of the exodus which began in 1939, and she defended the values of the Republic all the way. Once she acknowledged that expatriation was irreversible, she entered a profound exile of which Antigone reveals the essence, going from “deprivation” to “revelation” in a philosophical as well as a poetical manner, both in her essays and in her unique play, La Tumba de Antígona (1967), a striking metaphor of the fratricidal war and of exile. On the other hand, Griselda Gambaro’s Antígona furiosa (1986) rewrites Sophocles’ tragedy which denounces Argentine state terrorism in a vigorous revival of a furious Antigone. At a time sister and mother of the missing of the Dirty War, she claims her cry for justice in the name of human brotherhood.},

  abstract = {This essay argues that consumer culture is a medium through which the classical tradition becomes incorporated into everyday experience. It does this through a close examination of the Broadway musical The Pink Lady (1911), which plays with the theme of nymphs and satyrs and is set in a variety of commercial environments. This theme has been mediated by earlier responses to classical culture, and its reimagining in the production design has been particularly influenced by the Rococo period. However, this art-historical context has been transformed by new cultures of celebrity and mass media. Using a range of contemporary sociological responses to consumption, as well as later scholarship on the topic, I demonstrate that classical antiquity made an excellent source for modern commodification. Consumer culture has a substantial impact on people’s sense of social identity and the way in which the public sphere is constructed. The Pink Lady makes links between ancient nymphs and satyrs on the one hand and contemporary fashion and sexual mores on the other. Through analysis of this production, I explore the role classically inflected modes of consumption play in the overlapping phenomena of sexual expression, social identity and the cultivation of discernment. The classical tradition was shaped as much by the apparently democratizing impulse of modern consumption as it was by fantasies of aristocratic idleness.},

  abstract = {Critics are always reminding us that character-drawing in Greek tragedy was a very different thing from what we meet in the modern theatre, different and (it is implied) perhaps more limited or rudimentary. But this contrast between ancient and modern is too vague to be illuminating: we need to define exactly what kind of difference it is before we can decide whether it is important. In drama meant for live performance it can hardly be a difference of               technique               , since every playwright is limited to two basic means of character-drawing, what his figures say and do and what other people say and do to them and about them. Nor can there be much significance in differences of               convention               . Of course convention counts for something: a dramatist writing for three masked male actors, who must take all the speaking roles in his play, male or female indiscriminately, using a highly formal and declamatory style of acting in a large open-air theatre, will create characters which can be rendered in these circumstances. But there is no reason why the particular conventions of his time should limit his portrayal of character in any serious way: Lady Macbeth, after all, was written to be played by a teenage boy. Surely the differences that really demand attention are those of               attitude               .},

The complex dataset consists of material from a parallel corpus of fiction texts and a comparable corpus of football match reports. An interesting finding is that the verb use outnumbers the noun use in the fiction texts, whereas the noun use outnumbers the verb use in the match reports in both languages. Moreover, the analysis of the lemmas suggests that they have similar potential of use but with slightly different preferences, both across the genres and languages. It is also suggested that the English lemmas are more consistently used in negative contexts than the Norwegian ones. Finally, the method of combining data from two different types of contrastive corpora proved fruitful, as the results become more robust.},

Reflecting on Parks’ nuanced rejection of the idea that Father Comes Home from the Wars is an adaptation of the Odyssey, this article closes by explaining the urgency of directly addressing the challenges of being a racialized teacher in the Classics classroom rather than idealizing those teachers as the self-evident resolution of the racism in the field.},

  abstract = {This software paper describes ‘Stylometry with R’ (stylo), a flexible R package for the highlevel analysis of writing style in stylometry. Stylometry (computational stylistics) is concerned with the quantitative study of writing style, e.g. authorship verification, an application which has considerable potential in forensic contexts, as well as historical research. In this paper we introduce the possibilities of stylo for computational text analysis, via a number of dummy case studies from English and French literature. We demonstrate how the package is particularly useful in the exploratory statistical analysis of texts, e.g. with respect to authorial writing style. Because stylo provides an attractive graphical user interface for high-level exploratory analyses, it is especially suited for an audience of novices, without programming skills (e.g. from the Digital Humanities). More experienced users can benefit from our implementation of a series of standard pipelines for text processing, as well as a number of similarity metrics.},

It reveals threads that come together, but do not get mixed up, forming designs. As such, this technique is used as a metaphor to reflect on our methodological option. Based on these analyses, this concept represents the search for a fruitful “making think” concerning women who are excluded from formal educational processes, but who educate themselves in life, in the daily resistance to gender, class and race subjugation and, equally, in the work environment.},

The method deploys pre-trained large language model neural networks to gather metadata for a text that is amenable to downstream statistical analyses surfacing patterns of interest in character dialogue. We specifically focus on Shakespeare’s works, collecting metadata in the form of sentiment and emotion scores for each line of his plays. In addition to sentiment and emotion scores produced by NLP models, we also directly gather metadata such as genre, line length, and character gender. We show how these metadata may be used to illuminate a number of interesting patterns in Shakespearean character which may be difficult to detect from a direct reading of the texts. We use these metadata to expose statistically significant relationships in Shakespeare between character gender and the emotional content of that character’s dialogue, controlling for genre. We also present here the publicly available dataset that we have compiled to perform these analyses. The data collects text from Shakespeare’s plays along with a variety of metadata useful for this and other forms of analysis of Shakespeare’s works. The methodology demonstrated here may be extended to other varieties of metadata provided by large NLP models.},

Two tristichs spoken by Helen in the teikhoskopia are singled out for special attention. These lines can be construed not only as epigrams in the general sense, but more specifically as captions appended to an image of the Achaeans encamped on the plain of Troy. Since Helen's lines to a certain extent correspond to the function and style of catalogic poetry, reading them specifically as captions leads to a more nuanced understanding of both Homeric poetry and Homeric self-reference. By contrasting Helen's “epigrams” with those of Hektor, one can also discern a gender-based differentiation of poetic functions.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This article theorizes the capture of 3D data for manuscripts. To begin, it provides a much-needed definition of digitization: digitization as a scholarly intervention that captures in digital form aspects of a manuscript's materiality. Essential to this definition is scholarly intervention, without which digitization is regularly viewed as an act outside of scholarship, one disconnected from the research questions that should direct it. To support this definition, the essay examines three new digital technologies: multispectral imaging, DNA analysis, and image manipulation. What becomes immediately central to the essay is that such scholarly interventions regularly rely on collaborations with scientists. Once digitization is established as a scholarly intervention, the essay lays the theoretical groundwork for 3D capture as a new means for scholars to intervene. The article draws upon D. F. McKenzie's notion of a book as "an expressive form" and Jerome McGann's notion of a book as an "event" to theorize a manuscript as a performance, that is, as presenting and provoking experience. Through this theorizing, the article argues that 3D capture is needed to explore how a manuscript presents and provokes experience, examining well-known cultural acts performed by manuscripts, such as receiving a kiss and welcoming a hand for swearing an oath. Finally, the article discusses a recent approach to 3D capture carried out by the author, providing a link to downloadable 3D models and a VR or AR experience of the St Chad Gospels.},

Even the newer criticism, however, continues the critical elision of Antigone's siblings (particularly her sister, Ismene) and of her relationship to them. This oversight is emblematic of the problematic omission of the sibling from theoretical discourses in general. The neglected sibling is a model that allows us to move beyond both self-other dualisms and the mother-child dyad, which form the only grounds for intersubjectivity in contemporary debates. Sibling logic recognizes the subject as embedded in a transsubjective network of               partial others               , whose subjectivities are nonetheless partially, though differentially, shared. This article thereby provides a new approach to poststructuralist debates on subjectivity and the political.},

  abstract = {Spartan institutions were pictured as a model of political stability from the Classical period onwards. The so-called Spartan ‘mirage’ did not involve only its constitutional order but also social and economic institutions. Xenophon begins his               Constitution of the Lacedaemonians               by associating Spartan fame with the               politeia               set up by Lycurgus, which made the Laconian city the most powerful (δυνατωτάτη) and famous (ὀνομαστοτάτη)               polis               in Greece (Xen.               Lac.               1.1). In Aristotle's               Politics               , in which the assessment of Sparta is more complex and nuanced, one finds a critique of contemporary Spartan institutions as well as praise for Lycurgus as a great lawgiver who established the laws of Sparta (Arist.               Pol.               2.1269a69, 2.1273b20). Most other ancient sources often remark upon the unchangeable features of some Spartan institutions as a key aspect of Spartan εὐνομία. Thucydides maintains that, after a long period of war and               stasis               , the Dorians established excellent laws and Sparta employed the same constitution for more than four hundred years (Thuc. 1.18.1: τετρακόσια καὶ ὀλίγῳ πλείω ἐς τὴν τελευτὴν τοῦδε τοῦ πολέμου ἀφ᾽ οὗ Λακεδαιμόνιοι τῇ αὐτῇ πολιτείᾳ χρῶνται).},

Our approach is based on events, or, more precisely, on the narrativity of event representation at the level of discourse, or the how of narration. For presenting the approach, we first discuss the notion of event in narrative theory and its relation to narrativity and plot. We then propose the operationalization of events and narrativity as a discourse phenomena in accordance to these assumptions. In the last section, we optimize our approach by relating the parameters for events and narrativity to summaries. With this we relate the how to the what of narration and account for a comprehensive notion of plot based on a scalar event concept.},

  abstract = {This article builds on a mathematical explanation of one the most prominent stylometric measures, Burrows’s Delta (and its variants), to understand and explain its working. Starting with the conceptual separation between feature selection, feature scaling, and distance measures, we have designed a series of controlled experiments in which we used the kind of feature scaling (various types of standardization and normalization) and the type of distance measures (notably Manhattan, Euclidean, and Cosine) as independent variables and the correct authorship attributions as the dependent variable indicative of the performance of each of the methods proposed. In this way, we are able to describe in some detail how each of these two variables interact with each other and how they influence the results. Thus we can show that feature vector normalization, that is, the transformation of the feature vectors to a uniform length of 1 (implicit in the cosine measure), is the decisive factor for the improvement of Delta proposed recently. We are also able to show that the information particularly relevant to the identification of the author of a text lies in the profile of deviation across the most frequent words rather than in the extent of the deviation or in the deviation of specific words only.},

The theatrical audience’s knowledge of the comic tradition of choral disrobing allows Aristophanes to build suspense, to play with audience expectations, and to fulfill or deny the tradition as he sees fit.},

This article turns to actor-network theory (ANT) and its explorations of translation, comparison, and similar terms. ANT, it argues, offers an intriguing angle on such modes of relation. In literary studies, comparison has often been subject to stringent critique, accused of imposing false equivalences and oppressive forms of homogenization. Perhaps, however, we can flip things around, reassessing critique via a stress on the complexities of comparison.

  abstract = {This paper briefly surveys a history of reckoning with the limits of critique in cultural studies and sociology. It highlights affinities between the turn to postcritique in literary studies and the present generation of Frankfurt School thought, including a heightened attention to everyday life worlds and an interest in developing a more expansive affirmative vocabulary beyond existing theories of utopia. It then raises questions about the political effects of critique in contemporary culture and its potential to trigger counter-productive or unwanted results. In some contexts, it may be strategically wise to rein in the impulse to judge or condemn in the interests of fostering solidarity, empathy, and the building of cross-class coalitions.},

Sketch Engine is a web-based corpusanalysis tool that allows the user to inspect the lexical makeup of a text (cf. keyword lists), explore the surroundings of select items (cf. concordances) and identify fixed expressions in a text (cf. n-grams). We make available our corpus-preparation tool and our corpus configuration file for Sketch Engine. We use the Sketch Engine corpus to detect discontinuous verbal multi-word expressions, specifically support-verb constructions (e.g. to take a decision). We examine how support-verb constructions – through their structural and lexical properties – aid discourse coherence and cohesion throughout Xenophon’s treatise. We furthermore examine how the recurring support-verb constructions in the treatise reflect the scientific register of the text. The article shows how an understudied category of lexico-syntactic device (support-verb constructions) in classical Greek majorly aids discourse cohesion, structurally and contextually speaking. It also shows how an understudied text in the form of a technical treatise (On Horsemanship) majorly furthers insight into scientific literacy of the classical period. Finally, by making available our corpus-preparation tool and code, we hope to further collaboration and adaptation and thus improvement of existing tools and counteract the multiplication of tools.},

The aim of this work is to study how the chorus relates to other characters through the analysis of social networks that are generated on the scene. The object of the comparative study are three Greek works: Elektra by Sophocles, Iphigenia Among the Taurians by Euripides and The Eumenides by Aeschylus, against three modern Spanish dramas: Luces de bohemia by Valle-Inclán, Yerma and La casa de Bernarda Alba by García Lorca hosted in the Drama Corpora Project (DraCor).

  abstract = {In traditional mathematics lectures the instructor normally writes the definitions, theorems, and proofs covered on the board, and gives informal oral explanations that help to make sense of them. The students have to take notes. However, there are serious problems concerning students’ note-taking in traditional mathematics lectures. Students often cannot think about the information presented during the lecture as they are busy writing. Making sense of the content later is also difficult because many students do not include the lecturer’s oral explanations in their notes. One approach to addressing these problems can be the use of guided notes: a modified version of the instructor’s notes with certain blanks the students have to fill in during the lecture. We investigated to what extent guided notes can support students in their note-taking in mathematics lectures in a study using a mixed-method design. This study provides on the one hand quantitative data suggesting that guided notes are perceived as beneficial by many students for several aspects of their note-taking. On the other hand, it offers qualitative data illustrating how the use of guided notes can influence these aspects. The results indicate in particular that the use of guided notes can address some of the problems concerning students’ note-taking in traditional mathematics lectures, while it can also lead to new problems that one needs to be aware of.},

The volume as a whole - the first dedicated to this author - amply demonstrates the extraordinary creativity and continuing vitality of the poet from Himera"--},

  abstract = {It is no exaggeration to say that Aristotle's               Poetics               is one of the most influential documents in the history of Western tradition. Not only, after its re-discovery in the early sixteenth century, did it dominate literary theory and practice for no less than three hundred years. Even after it had lost its privileged status – first to the alternative theories of literature brought forth by the Romantic movement and then to the literary theory and practice of twentieth-century modernism – the               Poetics               still retained its role of the normative text in opposition to which those new theories were being formulated. It will suffice to bring to mind the explicitly non-Aristotelian theory of drama developed by Bertold Brecht to see that, even when rejected, it was the               Poetics               that dictated the agenda of the theorists.                                         This has changed in the last thirty years, with the emergence of post-modern literary theory. Although in the questioning of the notions of closure, of artistic illusion, of unity of plot the post-modern theory owes much more than it cares to admit to such modernists as Brecht or Adorno and through them to Aristotle, the               damnatio memoriae               it has imposed on the               Poetics               is so thorough that some theorists seem to be hardly aware of the very fact of its existence. This is probably why many theorists, in their privileging of emotional distancing over identification, meta-theatrality over illusion, formal and semantic openness over determinacy and closure, find their models in Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and other non-Western literary traditions rather than in ancient Greece. That is to say, in so far as Aristotle is no longer considered relevant to literary theory, Greek literary tradition too is not considered relevant. The tacit presupposition on which this attitude is based is that Aristotle's               Poetics               adequately represents ancient Greek literary practice.},

  abstract = {In recent decades, political theorists have significantly revised their understanding of Athenian democratic thinking. By opening up the canon, shifting their focus from abstract principles to democratic practices, and employing an increasingly diverse range of interpretive approaches, they have collectively reconstructed a more robust and multi-faceted account of the Athenian democratic public sphere. Despite its ecumenical ambitions and manifest successes, however, this project has been fettered by a singular focus on language as the medium of democratic politics. As can be seen in the gloss of one of its contributors, this body of work effectively limits the democratic public sphere to ‘the domain in which judgments and public opinion are shaped and formed               through speech               ’. This logocentric demarcation of democratic practice does not harmonize well with our own experience of modern politics, however, where public monuments, political imagery, and civic spaces play a critical role in the formation of political understanding and judgment, as well as starting points for discussion, debate, and disagreement. It seems similarly out of tune with what we know about the ancient Greeks, who demonstrated a readiness to move between visual and verbal content in reflecting on political and ethical life, and who developed the very idea of               theôria               out of an extension of the process of seeing. If, as political theorists, we can temper our habitual logocentrism and learn to attend more closely to the visual culture of Athenian democracy, we stand to add new dimensions to our collective reconstruction of the democratic public sphere and, in turn, to enhance our understanding of those texts that have long preoccupied our attention.},

  abstract = {This article demonstrates how a particular type of narrative formula in Homer—the pivotal counterfactual—creates in contexts of lamentation a suggestive correspondence between the desire to mourn and the desire to hear (and relate) more narrative. The various other structural functions of such formulae are best understood in relation to this more fundamental effect. Pivotal counterfactuals that express a longing for extended mourning occur in thematically parallel locations in the Iliad and Odyssey, and significantly enhance the power of subsequent formal lamentations while reinforcing the narrative teleology of both poems.},

The case study is an ancient traveling narrative, Pausanias’s Description of Greece (Periegesis Hellados) which was written in the second century CE. First, we describe the process of converting the volumes to spatial data using a customized version of the open-source digital semantic annotation platform Recogito. Then the focus shifts to the implementation of collected and organized spatial data to a number of GIS applications: namely Google Maps, DARIAH Geo-Browser, Gephi, Palladio and ArcGIS. Through empirical experimentation with spatial data and their implementation in different platforms, our paper charts the ways in which contemporary GIS applications may be implemented to cast new light on ancient understandings of identity, space, and place.},

The repeated themes, sounds, gestures, images, and phrases in the play’s strophic pairs serve as well to define and perform the changing relation between Persian royal leaders and their choral subjects in the play as a whole.},

The ability to collate speech data from different researchers and to leverage external repositories of texts and characters opens up new possibilities for interrogation of the epic corpus. We briefly survey the current state of scholarship on epic speeches and of the digital infrastructure on which we propose to build. We outline a model for harmonizing speech data across studies and aligning it with existing LOD standards. Finally, we discuss some early proof-of-concept results and the larger implications of this approach for the field. The long-term aim of the DICES project is to build a database of metadata on direct speech in Greek and Latin epic, not only covering canonical texts such as Homer and Virgil, but also including the less-studied texts of the late antique period, which will benefit greatly both from the increased accessibility and also from the diachronic perspective afforded by a corpus-based approach. The envisioned database also has the potential to include diachronic data from additional genres and languages at a later stage.},

  abstract = {The idea that the household was the fundamental building block of ancient Greek society, explicit in the ancient sources, has now become widely accepted. It is no exaggeration to say that ancient Athenians would have found it almost inconceivable that individuals of any status existed who did not belong to               some               household; and the few who were in this position were almost certainly regarded as anomalous. In ancient Athens, as elsewhere, households ‘are a primary arena for the expression of age and sex roles, kinship, socialization and economic cooperation’. It has been suggested for modern Greece that our own cultural biases, along with the Greek ideology of male dominance, have led to the assumption that the foundations of power in Greek society lie solely in the public sphere, and that domestic power is ‘less important’. In a less simple reality the preeminent role of the household cannot be underestimated. Here I hope to question similar assumptions about ancient Greece, focusing in particular on the relationships that existed between Athenian households and the property of the individuals, particularly women, within these households.},

This interdisciplinary research engages comparative literature, Latin American studies, classical reception, history, feminist theory, political philosophy, and theatre history. Moira Fradinger tracks the ways in which, since the early nineteenth century, fragments of Antigone's myth and tragedy have been persistently cannibalized and ruminated throughout South and Central America and the Caribbean, quilted to local dramatic forms, revealing an archive of political thought about Latin America's heterogeneous neo-colonial histories. Antígona is consistently characterized as a national mother and, as the twentieth century advances, multiplied on stage, forming female collectives, foregrounding the urgency of systemic change or staging gender politics. Through meticulous examination of classical culture in necolonial contexts, Fradinger explores ways of reading Creole texts from the geopolitical South that disrupt the colonial reading protocols that deracinate texts or lock them into locality. By historicizing Antígona plays and interpreting them with a purpose to address specific colonial legacies, the book reveals how Antígona has ceased being Greek and instead tells stories of twentieth- and twenty-first-century Latin America. Antígonas rethinks the paradigms through which we understand the presence of ancient cultural materials in former colonial territories, while illuminating an understudied continent in Anglophone reception studies."--Publisher's description},

  abstract = {Sophocles'               Trachiniae               has provoked among the critics a broad variety of responses ranging from strong censure and denial of Sophoclean authorship at one extreme to expressions of approval and great praise at the other. In recent years the literature on the play has tended to approach the drama in a more sympathetic vein and critics have displayed a much more positive stance to both the contents and dramaturgy of the play. Although the debates about such questions as those of date, structure, purpose, theme, characterization, and unity continue, elements of the drama which earlier writers had tended to pass over, treat in an apologetic view, or even ascribe to the presence of textual flaws have been examined in a frank and open manner with positive results. The fact remains, however, that despite these advances there still persists a considerable reluctance to accept the figure of Heracles as he is presented in the drama. There can be no doubt that the characterization of Heracles is the fundamental reason why the               Trachiniae               has long been regarded as the great problem play of the Sophoclean corpus, and while for the most part we have moved from the blanket condemnation of this character that marked many earlier studies, the tendency to regard Heracles and consequently the               Trachiniae               as anomalies persists.},

  abstract = {Political theory often sees disability through the negative language of abnormality and inability, which perceives disability as a deficiency that deviates from the able-bodied. However, critical disability studies strives to transform the disabling language of political theory into an enabling project that sees the ability, unique perspectives, capacities, and contributions of people with disabilities. Through Sophocles’ Philoctetes, this article examines the negative ways in which disability is conceptualized, socially constructed, and (dis)valued, as well as the possibilities for a positive and enabling theory of disability. The character of Philoctetes exposes the negative social construction of disability as well as the extraordinary ability of those who live with chronic impairments. The Philoctetes meditates on the status of the disabled who are unfairly isolated from human community and who are often unfairly seen in an instrumental fashion that fails to recognize their fundamental status as human beings who are capable, valuable, and essential for the success of human endeavors and community. For political theory, the Philoctetes demonstrates the ability in disability, and shines brightly on the essential contributions that people with disabilities make in our societies. Philoctetes shows that the lives of people who live daily with chronic impairments need not be seen as necessarily tragic. Instead, these modes of being speak to human diversity, ingenuity, and triumph.},

By drawing on the latest scholarship on ancient archaeology, art, literature, and funerary inscriptions, Robert Garland invites readers to put themselves in the sandals of ancient peoples and to imagine their mental state moment by moment as they sought—in ways that turn out to be remarkably similar to ours—to assist the dead on their journey to the next world and to understand life’s greatest mystery.What to Expect When You’re Dead chronicles the ways ancient peoples answered questions such as: How to achieve a good death and afterlife? What’s the best way to dispose of a body? Do the dead face a postmortem judgement—and where do they end up? Do the dead have bodies in the afterlife—and can they eat, drink, and have sex? And what can the living do to stay on good terms with the nonliving?Filled with intriguing stories and frequent humor, What to Expect When You’re Dead will be a morbidly delicious treat for every reader alive},

  abstract = {Abstract: Boethius's Consolation of Philosophy was among the many Latin texts translated for growing vernacular readerships in France, England, and Italy in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. But the Consolation presents a special challenge for both translators and scribes, for all-prose translation flattens the formal variety of Boethius's original Latin prosimetrum. How do scribes negotiate between the form of all-prose translation and the form of the original text? In one copy of Chaucer's English Boece (Cambridge, Cambridge University Library MS Ii.1.38) and in two manuscripts of Italian Boethius translations (Florence, Biblioteca Riccardiana MS 1003 and Vatican City, Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana Reginensis Lat. 1971), prose translations of Boethius's meters are laid out as if they were verse. This essay discusses how, in CUL Ii.1.38, book one meter one of the Consolation is treated as non-metrical verse on the model of the Latin Psalter. It then turns to the Italian tradition to explore how the layout of translated meters is involved in the movement of vernacular translation from the margins to the center of the page. Throughout, it argues that these manuscripts create space for readers to approach prose translation as if it were poetry and to perceive the form of these translations though the memory of the Latin prosimetrum. These manuscripts suggest how form might emerge through a collaboration between the words of the text, their material instantiation, and the memory and imagination of readers.},

Considered together, this research represents an extraordinary event in the long history of textuality. More or less all at once, the "corpus" has emerged as a major genre of cultural and scientific knowledge. In "Literary Mathematics," Michael Gavin grapples with this development, describing how quantitative methods for the study of textual data offer powerful tools for historical inquiry and sometimes unexpected perspectives on theoretical issues of concern to literary studies. Student-friendly and accessible, the book advances this argument through case studies drawn from the "Early English Books Online" corpus. Gavin shows how a co-publication network of printers and authors reveals an uncannily accurate picture of historical periodization; that a vector-space semantic model parses historical concepts in incredibly fine detail; and that a geospatial analysis of early modern discourse offers a surprising panoramic glimpse into the period's notion of world geography. Across these case studies, Gavin challenges readers to consider why corpus-based methods work so effectively and asks whether the successes of formal modeling ought to inspire humanists to reconsider fundamental theoretical assumptions about textuality and meaning. As Gavin reveals, by embracing the expressive power of mathematics, scholars can add new dimensions to digital humanities research and find new connections with the social sciences"--},

Although the social and economic influence of the Jesuits in South America has been well documented, no study has focussed on the literary and theological interest of these scriptural meditations, or the significant extent to which they innovate scriptural reading in response to the spiritual challenges posed by the new missionary contexts. The submitted article offers a close reading of a fascinating example of this innovative exegetical style by examining excerpts from the Canticum Habacuc Illustratum by Lucas Vicente Imperial (Quito, 1642). While bringing to light the Augustinian models that inspire this particular kind of exegetical reception, the text also shows the nuances of Jesuit biblical exegesis and its specific connection with contemporary and practical needs.},

This study investigates the relationship between AI tool usage and critical thinking skills, focusing on cognitive offloading as a mediating factor. Utilising a mixed-method approach, we conducted surveys and in-depth interviews with 666 participants across diverse age groups and educational backgrounds. Quantitative data were analysed using ANOVA and correlation analysis, while qualitative insights were obtained through thematic analysis of interview transcripts. The findings revealed a significant negative correlation between frequent AI tool usage and critical thinking abilities, mediated by increased cognitive offloading. Younger participants exhibited higher dependence on AI tools and lower critical thinking scores compared to older participants. Furthermore, higher educational attainment was associated with better critical thinking skills, regardless of AI usage. These results highlight the potential cognitive costs of AI tool reliance, emphasising the need for educational strategies that promote critical engagement with AI technologies. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI’s cognitive implications, offering practical recommendations for mitigating its adverse effects on critical thinking. The findings underscore the importance of fostering critical thinking in an AI-driven world, making this research essential reading for educators, policymakers, and technologists.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on Simone Weil’s translation and reception of Homer’s Iliad. Some criitics have called it a misreading, but I contend that translation and reception comes in many forms and that it is a mistake to label non-literal translations as “misreadings.” My analysis of Weil’s Homer also focuses on how Weil’s writing about war is marked by her identity as a woman and a woman who is drawn to epic poetry. The article focuses on two episodes in the Iliad: Priam and Achilles in Book 24 and Lycaon and Achilles in Book 21.},

  abstract = {This article explores Vergil’s allusions in the Aeneid to Sophocles’s Theban plays, Oedipus the King, Oedipus at Colonus, and Antigone. The allusions are put in the context of (a) analogies between civil strife in Roman history and familial strife in Theban myth, and (b) Vergil’s recall of Greek tragedy. Dido, Aeneas, and Turnus all find counterparts in Sophocles’s Theban plays. At times Dido resembles the Antigone in the play of that name; at others the Oedipus of Oedipus the King. Aeneas twice in Aeneid 7 and 8 resembles the Oedipus of the Coloneus; finally Turnus resembles Antigone in several moments of Aeneid 12. The allusions to the Antigone are reinforced by similarities with Accius’s Antigona. The Sophoclean intertextuality intersects with several themes in Vergil, including the limits of human knowledge, the connection between death and marriage, and the recrudescent tendency towards civil war. Vergil’s aetiological framework becomes crossed with a poetics of civil war and intrafamilial strife as these are transmitted down through the generations.},

The question is not simply whether literature thinks, but whether literature thinks theoretically--whether it has a capacity, without the external aid of analytical methods that have determined Western philosophy and science since the Enlightenment, to theorize the conditions of the world from which it emerges and to which it addresses itself. Suspicion about literature's access to knowledge is ancient, at least as old as Plato's notorious expulsion of the poets from the city in the Republic. With full awareness of this classical background and in dialogue with a broad range of twentieth-century thinkers, Gourgouris examines a range of literary texts, from Sophocles' Antigone to Don DeLillo's The Names, as he traces out his argument that literature possesses an intrinsic theoretical capacity to make sense of the nonpropositional},

  abstract = {The key role that animals play in our aesthetic appreciation of the natural world has only gradually been highlighted in discussions in environmental aesthetics. In this article I make use of the phenomenological notion of ‘perceptual sense’ as developed by Merleau-Ponty to argue that open-ended expressiveresponsive movement is the primary aesthetic ground for our appreciation of animals. It is through their movement that the array of qualities we admire in animals are manifest qua animal qualities. Against functionalist and formalist accounts, I defend and develop an account of expressive-responsive movement as the primary perceptual sense of animals. I go on to suggest that the primacy of movement in the aesthetic appreciation of animals is also the primary sense of animal ‘wildness’, and that a key part of the rewilding paradigm should be the development of such appreciation.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This chapter offers a fresh look at the false messenger scene in Sophocles’ Electra through the combined lenses of ancient criticism and cognitive studies. In a first step, it contends that the claims of Gorgias fr. B 23 DK correspond with insights of cognitive accounts of aesthetic experience. In its main part, the chapter reconsiders Electra in the light of Gorgias fr. B 23 DK, suggesting that the false messenger speech stages the entwinement of deception with aesthetic illusion with which Gorgias fr. B 23 DK plays. It is first shown that the messenger speech is geared towards generating a strong aesthetic illusion. Then it is argued that the very devices that serve to engross the theatre audience are simultaneously a means of deception within the play. As pointed out in the conclusion, this association of aesthetics with ethics reveals a specifically ancient approach and sheds light on the limits as well as the benefits of employing cognitive studies in classics.},

  abstract = {A widely-used method in corpus-linguistic approaches to discourse analysis, register/text type/genre analysis, and educational/curriculum questions is that of keywords analysis, a simple statistical method aiming to identify words that are key to, i.e. characteristic for, certain discourses, text types, or topic domains. The vast majority of keywords analyses relied on the same statistical measure that most collocation studies are using, the log-likelihood ratio, which is performed on frequencies of occurrence in two corpora under consideration. In a recent paper, Egbert and Biber (2019) advocated a different approach, one that involves computing loglikelihood ratios for word types based on the range of their distribution rather than their frequencies in the target and reference corpora under consideration. In this paper, I argue that their approach is a most welcome addition to keywords analysis but can still be profitably extended by utilizing both frequency and dispersion for keyness computations. I am presenting a new twodimensional approach to keyness and exemplifying it on the basis of the Clinton-Trump Corpus and the British National Corpus.},

By defining several key measurements of Latin lexical complexity, we establish a provisional account of the lexical difficulty of some familiar Latin texts that are frequently taught in elementary, intermediate, and advanced levels, and propose LexR, a single, informative, integrated score that provides a sense of the comparative lexical complexity of Latin texts.},

Guariglia explores the New York City Police Department through its periods of experimentation and violence as police experts import tactics from the US occupation of the Philippines and Cuba, devise modern bureaucratic techniques to better suppress Black communities, and infiltrate supposedly-unknowable immigrant neighborhoods. Innovations ranging from recruiting Chinese, Italian, or German police to form "ethnic squads," the use of deportation and federal immigration restrictions to control local crime-even the introduction of fingerprinting-were motivated by attempts to govern a multiracial city. Campaigns to remake the police department created an urban landscape where power, gender, sexuality, race, ethnicity, crime, and bodies collided and provided a foundation for the supposedly "colorblind," technocratic, federally-backed, and surveillance-based policing of today"--},

No scholar has analyzed the discipline's contradictions as authoritatively as John Guillory, whose 1993 book Cultural Capital: The Problem of Literary Canon Formation remains a classic and whose subsequent essays on the profession of literary study have been widely cited. In this much-anticipated new book, Guillory shows how literary study has been organized, both historically and in the modern era, both before and after its professionalization. The traces of this volatile history, he shows, have solidified into permanent features of the university. Yet the discipline continues to be troubled by the relation between discipline and profession, both in its ambivalence about the literary object and in its anxious embrace of a professionalism that betrays the discipline's relation to its amateur precursor: criticism. In a series of essays, several previously unpublished, Guillory unpacks what it means to "profess criticism." His book gives a timely and incisive explanation for the perennial churn in literary study, the constant revolutionizing of its methods and objects, and the permanent crisis of its professional identification. It closes with a robust outline of five key rationales for literary study, offering a credible account of the aims of the discipline and a reminder to the professoriate of what they already do, and often do well"--},

This essay traces the emergence of a rhetoric of salvation and survival in academic advocacy literature, evident in the genres, arguments, and metaphors that writers use to describe the academic humanities. Focusing, first, on a set of recent books that advocate for the humanities as a resource for deliberation, community formation, and critique, the essay then turns to the origin of the contemporary humanities in European philology as a background for the dualism of survival and crisis in narratives about the humanities. The essay concludes by arguing that we need a new framework for understanding the survival of the humanities as global humanities, in particular, one that does not emerge from a European and Christological sense of survival. Drawing upon research conducted as part of the “World Humanities Report,” the essay identifies some of these alternative frameworks based upon the humanities in China, South Africa, and Argentina.},

What happened in the last few decades to prompt such an extensive rethinking of our understanding of gendered embodiment? How did a stigmatized identity become so central to US and European articulations of self? And how have people responded to the new definitions and understanding of sex and the gendered body?

  abstract = {"WILD THINGS is queer theorist Jack Halberstam's account of sexuality in general, and queerness in particular, after nature. As the heterosexual/homosexual binary emerged in the late 19th-century and coalesced in the 20th-century, discourses of both heterosexuality and homosexuality defined sexuality in relation to nature and the natural world. The most well-known is the homophobic framing of homosexuality as unnatural, aberrant, and "against" nature, but of equal importance is the 19th-century male dandy's positioning of artifice and camp-and through it homosexuality-as anti-natural. On the other hand, heterosexuality was often held up as the "natural" sexuality and, later in the 20th-century, gay scientists tried to prove that homosexuality was a natural, biological desire. In this book, Halberstam mobilizes wildness as an analytic through which an alternative history of sexuality and desire outside of heterosexuality, homosexuality, and taxonomical classifications can emerge. To that end, Halberstam turns back to the orderly, taxonomical, and classified homosexuality and heterosexuality of the 19th and 20th-centuries and asks: what embodiments and desires were swept under the carpet in the process of creating identitarian sexualities? Halberstam claims these excluded and unruly figures as "wild" lives lived out in embodiments and desires which eluded the orderly classifications of their era. Wildness, for Halberstam, thus becomes a way to claim an "epistemology of the ferox," a way of being and knowing in the world which is not the opposition of order but order's absence: a force which "disorders desire and desires disorder." Although he is clear that wildness and queerness are not interchangeable, Halberstam sees in wildness and "wild thought" queer theory's anti-identitarian impulse to explore life outside of the limits of the human and liberal governance. More than just a project of recuperating queer figures lost in the archive, Halberstam's WILD THINGS argues for a revision of queer history, one in which "nature" and the "natural world" does not function as that which sexuality defines itself with and against"--},

From the Homeric epics to fourth-century comedy and vase-painting, Hephaestus is consistently to be found in cultural contexts which explore the instrumentality of laughter in domestic and social relationships, rituals and entertainments. The article proposes that the structure of the mythical narrative of the Return of Hephaestus, with its estrangement of the protagonist from his community, riotous reconciliation, and komastic procession, underlies several Old Comedies. It also suggests that his banausic profession and deformity helped to make him particularly popular in cultural artifacts—vases and dramas—produced in Athens in the democratic period because neither his trade nor his appearance would have disqualified him from wielding sovereign power, κράτος, as a citizen there.},

In constructing and exploring this thematic configuration of mirrors, metaphors, and Plato, the chief concern is to draw out—via a small selection of texts, including passages from Schopenhauer and Nietzsche—some underappreciated complexity in the various classical traditions that have contributed to aesthetics and philosophy of art.},

Our research has resulted in the successful identification of horizontal strokes in 2D images of cuneiform tablets, some of them from very different periods, separated by hundreds of years from each other.

By means of rhetoric, architecture, inscriptions, statues, archives and even legislation, the \&apos;classical\&apos; tragedians (Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides) and their plays came to be presented as both the products and vital embodiments of an idealised Athenian past.

Various modes of digitization may be appropriate for addressing those questions, especially when a manuscript is studied as more than a text container. The advantages and disadvantages compared to firsthand experience are different for each mode. The article addresses, in particular, those modes that attend to range and resolution of reflected, fluoresced, and transmitted color (multispectral imaging) and texture (reflectance transformation imaging [RTI]). It concludes by considering current tools for integrating spectral imaging and RTI.},

This study presents a novel approach for the study of its historical development, exploring in particular the concept of mode. Based on a large dataset of approximately 13,000 musical pieces in MIDI format, we present two models to infer both the number and characteristics of modes of different historical periods from first principles: a geometric model of modes as clusters of musical pieces in a non-Euclidean space, and a cognitively plausible Bayesian model of modes as Dirichlet distributions. We use the geometric model to determine the optimal number of modes for five historical epochs via unsupervised learning and apply the probabilistic model to infer the characteristics of the modes. Our results show that the inference of four modes is most plausible in the Renaissance, that two modes–corresponding to major and minor–are most appropriate in the Baroque and Classical eras, whereas no clear separation into distinct modes is found for the 19th century.},

The plans for the revolt were reported to the Athenians (3.2), who sent a force against the city (3.3). The Mytilenians asked for help from the Spartans (3.4.5–6), but the fleet they sent arrived too late to help the city (3.26.4). The revolt appears to have been the initiative of the city's wealthier citizens: Thucydides reports (3.27–8) that heavy armour was not distributed to the people until Salaethus, the leader of the rebellion, realized that Spartan help would not arrive in time. Once the people received this armour, they refused to take orders from officials and held meetings, insisting that the government should distribute all available grain. If they did not, they threatened to negotiate on their own with the Athenians about surrender. The government was powerless to stop them and decided it was best to come to terms with the Athenians. It was agreed that the Athenians would have the power to act as they wished with the city and that the Mytilenians would have the right to send envoys to Athens to plead their case before the Assembly.},

One hundred years later, it is thriving at colleges and universities throughout the United States and gaining a foothold abroad as well. This essay recounts its growth, surveys its campus manifestations, and explores the challenges it now confronts. In a world of ever-advancing technologies, of evolving forms of online interaction, and of massive amounts of misinformation and disinformation, no citizen can ignore the changing media environment. While the communication discipline can take pride in its growth, it must also heed the demands of the Old Humanities: to sort fact from fiction, to identify cultural traditions worth honoring, to question how power is arranged and whom it serves, and to help students formulate messages for a diverse and changing world. The field of communication has many challenges before it and that is a glorious thing.},

  abstract = {This dissertation contends that it is productive to consider tragedy a complex lyric genre, with the chorus serving as the primary vehicle of that lyricism. While recent scholarship on the tragic choral odes has established their close interactions with extra-dramatic lyric genres and Athenian song culture, the hermeneutic implications of tragic lyricism beyond the plays’ original performance contexts have thus far remained largely unexplored. Lyric has long been recognized as a mode of expression with different aims and means from mimetic, diegetic narratives, oriented less towards rational argumentation than towards aesthetic synchrony and semiotic experimentation. The introduction draws from a wide range of sources (both ancient and modern) to construct an apparatus for approaching the plays, defining a methodology termed “choral reading.” This mode values both close philological attention to the plays’ texture and musicality and attention to the plenitude (or “chorus”) of artistic, philosophical and theoretical attention the texts have accrued over their reception histories. Such “choral reading” is pursued in three chapters, each devoted to a single play. The chorus of Sophocles’  Antigone posits a cosmic order in the Ode to Man that is merely hypothetical, one that, as the play progresses, it continuously revises and refines with existential consequences for the human and the humanist. In Euripides’  Bacchae, the multi-generic potentialities of the dramatic form are exploited to infect the play with a hyperchorality that allows for the enactment of multiple synchronic competing versions of the myth of the birth of Dionysus. Attention to this mode of story-telling is illustrative for thinking about how victims of trauma communicate the affect that accompanied a horrific event rather than a narrative of cause and effect. In Aeschylus’  Agamemnon, the terms that constitute the play’s famous adage  pathei mathos are constructed and complicated via the chorus’s exploration of the experiential quality of various temporal modes. The play employs tragedy’s formal capacities to dramatize the shadowy space between suffering or witnessing a traumatic experience and the ability to articulate the event and its significance, a pattern that is reflected in contemporary psychoanalytic trauma theory.},

This exaggerated distance and proximity evokes an ambivalent affective experience, identified here with “the sublime” à la Longinus but also Lyotard, with a corollary in Kristeva’s abject.},

  urldate = {2024-05-14},
  abstract = {On some accounts, Sophocles’ Philoctetes is most notable for what it lacks: alone among the extant Attic tragedies, there are no women in the dramatis personae; alone among the extant plays of Sophocles, no characters die; and the chorus plays a relatively diminished role, adhering most closely to Aristotle’s injunction in the Poetics that a chorus should take on the role of an actor. But when viewed through the lens of ecocritical feminism and vibrant materialism, notably the work of Donna Haraway, Mel Chen, Jane Bennett, and Anna Tsing, the play’s landscape, the island of Lemnos, comes to life; and it teems with feminine energies as well as compromised and complicated animacies, while the chorus serves as an empathic focalizer and world-builder. This paper argues that in addition to animating the island’s material ecosystem, Sophocles conjures Lemnos’ mythic ecosystem, most notably the tale of the notorious, murderous, and malodorous Lemnian Women. All of these elements cohere to characterize Philoctetes as an abject, sterile menstruator. Furthermore, the chorus’s brief, strange Hymn to Gaia encapsulates the play’s tension between a masculine, heroic, teleological narrative and the feminine, primordial, bestial world of Lemnos. These dynamics are further considered through the lens of fifth-century Athenian colonization, the story of the indigenous Lemnian Pelasgians, and a colonial reading of the Odyssey’s Cyclopeia. Finally, the paper explores the close, mutually constitutive relationship between text, landscape, and body via the popularity, in later antiquity, of pharmacological applications of Lemnian Earth, used to treat, among other ailments, snakebites and menstruation.},

The process primarily took place in the city of Nippur in the troubled decades after 1740 BC, as the ancient scholars desperately needed to assert their importance. They did so by claiming special access to Sumerian literature, and authorship served as an ideal vehicle to represent that literature and that access. In short, Enheduana became a body and a bridge for Sumerian literature, condensing it into a single object and allowing it to move into a new cultural context.},

Plato's cave forces the theatre, the political space of ancient Greek representation, to confront its material dependency upon a space from which it is otherwise visually and territorially separated: the mines where intensive use was made of slave labor. As many have argued, the most salient aspects of Plato's allegory of the cave are the complete absence of               lexis               (speech) and               praxis               (action), the evacuation of the acoustic and the distortion of the visual. These are also the most decisive features when delimiting the border between the free and the unfree in Greek antiquity:                                Do you think these prisoners have ever seen anything of themselves and one another besides the shadows that the fire casts on the wall of the cave in front of them? … And if they could engage in discussion with one another, don't you think they would assume that the words they used applied to the things they see passing in front of them?},

  abstract = {Sophocles' Oedipus at Colonus has traditionally been regarded as the poet's primary tragedy involving hero cult; this essay explores the more subtle but no less ritually explicit hero cult of the Aias first outlined by Burian. The passage, as Burian saw, occurs when the young Eurysakes kneels at his father's body and Teukros conducts an unusual combination of rites: supplication, curse, offering of hair, and magic (1168-84). One crucial direction to the child, kai phulasse (1180), however, is here not understood to be a paradox of the suppliant who "protects" what he seizes but rather his physical attachment to the locus where he abides as well as his ritual dependence on the source of protection (as with Orestes in Eum. 242f., 439f.). By saying a curse and obtaining protection, Teukros and Eurysakes indicate how the still-warm body of the dead hero has already acquired special powers after death: specifically, the power to bestow both blessings and curses on mortals. The argument turns from the body to the tomb, the physical and lasting monument of hero cult, which the Sophoclean audience would know. The preceding scene ends with a pivotal choral passage where the hero's burial and cult are prescribed in highly Homeric terms (1163-67). This passage forms an important link between the opposing views of the fate of the corpse (Menelaos vs. Teukros) and also between the hero's death and burial. This choral celebration of the hero's future status is cast in traditional Homeric language, but with some revealing inversions. One is the reversal of the verb whereby the earth "holds" (katechei) or possesses heroes in Homer, while Aias occupies and possesses his tomb (1167, kathexei). The evolution of Homeric views of death is traced (Archilochos, Simonides). In Sophocles' Aias the chorus performs the burial as a ritual act establishing a cult, long before it happens at the end of the play. The article concludes with a discussion of the historical cults of Aias known to the Athenians and of the more significant way that Aias (a suicide) becomes a hero: not self-consciously, as Oedipus did, but through rituals performed by his family and community. In the Aias, the poet's sense of hero cult lies closer to Homer and the epic tradition than it does, for instance, to Aeschylus.},

It blends explanations of the theory's general principles-dialogic form, expositional action zones, trajectories toward generically normative cadences, rotation theory, the five sonata types, the special case of the minor-mode sonata, and more-with illustrations of them in practice through close, extended analyses of eight individual movements by Mozart, Haydn, Beethoven, Schubert, and Brahms. Central to the method is the merging of historically informed, technical analysis with the concerns of hermeneutic interpretation. The book features an inclusive engagement with recent developments in form theory, schema theory, and other related studies since 2006, including some of the language and insights of cognitive research into music perception and the more generalized concerns of conceptual metaphor theory. It ultimately builds to reflections on sonata form in the romantic era: the flexible applicability of Sonata Theory to mid- and late-nineteenth-century works"--},

Progress in this field dedicated to the computational analysis of literary texts has long revolved around the new, digital tools: tools, as computational devices for analysis, have had here a comparatively strong status as research entities of their own, while their ontological status has remained unclear to the day. As a rule, they have widely been imported from the fields of data science and NLP, while less often being hand-tailored to specific tasks within interdisciplinary settings. Although studies within CLS are evolving to both a higher degree of specialization in method (going beyond the limitations of out-of-the-box tools) and a stronger theoretical modeling, the technological dimension remains a defining factor. An unreflective adoption of technology in the shape of tools can compromise the plausibility and the reproducibility of the results produced using these tools.},

We argue that these falsehoods, and the overall activity of large language models, is better understood as bullshit in the sense explored by Frankfurt (On Bullshit, Princeton, 2005): the models are in an important way indifferent to the truth of their outputs. We distinguish two ways in which the models can be said to be bullshitters, and argue that they clearly meet at least one of these definitions. We further argue that describing AI misrepresentations as bullshit is both a more useful and more accurate way of predicting and discussing the behaviour of these systems.},

It suggests that Sophoclean self-killing, often considered quintessentially individualistic, in fact reflects a preoccupation with the autocheir, a less definite figure than our “suicide,” since s/he may also be (actually or potentially) a kin-killer. Also, that where Sophocles attempts to distinguish self-killing from kin-killing, it is to isolate and explore the nature and (not inevitably negative) implications of autocheiria. Close readings of scenes from Antigone, Ajax, and Trachiniae demonstrate that this is achieved through the elision or obscuring of the moment of self-destruction, and the posthumous analysis of self-killing in the “verbal post-mortem.” A strand of metacriticism suggests that editors committed to a model of suicide as unequivocal act intentionally performed by a single agent have sometimes oversimplified the complexity evidenced by the transmitted text.},

Book 1 of the 'Description' covers Athens, its demes, and Megara--that is, Attica, the heart of the ancient Greek world. It offers not only a walking description of buildings, statues, and artwork by an ancient traveler but also insight into the mindset of an educated Greek of the Roman imperial age: his reaction to Roman domination and Classical Greek history and culture, his deeply felt religious beliefs, and his ideas regarding Hellenism and Hellenic identity. This textbook, the first on Pausanias aimed at students in almost a century, brings Pausanias back into the classroom for a new generation of readers. It is based on the Greek text edited by M.H. Rocha-Pereira and includes philological and historical commentary by Hogan. This volume elucidates difficult syntax and helps the reader with the immense number of names and places Pausanias mentions. It is suitable for students of Classical Greek at the graduate and undergraduate levels, whether Classical philologists or Classical archaeologists and art historians. Professors of archaeology will find this textbook an excellent starting point for any course on Pausanias and easily supplemented by their own knowledge of material remains and modern finds" --},

  abstract = {In digital studies of the use of words in intellectual history, meaning is measured based on the idea of Firth that a word can be characterized by the company it keeps. The words that are literally close to it in the texts in which it is written should tell us something about what the word means. In practice, we will look at meaning being measured by a method called Pointwise Mutual Information or PMI for short. However, even granting that we use PMI, this description is still quite vague and allows for multiple different ways to interpret 'the company a word keeps' in the practice of coding an actual algorithm to discern this company. In this paper we will look specifically at the choice to 1. use all words close to another or 2. use merely the ones that are most disproportionately present. Using work from contemporary philosophers of language Mark Wilson and Sally Haslanger, we argue that both capture an aspect of meaning, 2 capturing the most salient way to understand a word, and 1 capturing the subtle, not so salient, but nonetheless important ways in which words are used overall. Then we will look to measure the overall stability in word meaning, the degree to which it is used similarly in different texts within a corpus. Having characterized PMI, salience and stability we will introduce Salience Differentiated Stability or SDS, a value indicating both the salient and less salient stability of a word, which will help identify words that are simpler or more shifty than they at first appear. Lastly we will test the use of this new value by doing a case study of the salience differentiated stability of common terms in early modern physics text books.},

Folding the history of gender, race, colonialism, and capital into geological time, Holloway retells the story of human beings in the Anthropocene in order to direct us towards ways of life that are external to it. Examining contemporary art, he considers how the reinvention of epic is challenging us to face climate change collectively. The final section on politics proposes a radical form of democracy that will have to be won and yet reconceived as a zoocracy, a rule of all of the living. Holloway takes up difficult, unanswered questions in recent work by Donna Haraway, Kathryn Yusoff, Bruno Latour, Dipesh Chakrabarty, and Isabelle Stengers, and engages with the fields of feminism, postcolonialism, political theory, Black studies, and Continental philosophy. Ultimately, this book explores a way to live and assemble at the end that resists both neoliberalism and ethnonationalism"--},

  abstract = {In this article, I analyze the role of Heracles' famous body in the representation of madness and its aftermath in Euripides' Heracles. Unlike studies of Trachiniae, interpretations of Heracles have neglected the hero's body in Euripides. This reading examines the eruption of that body midway through the tragedy as a part of Heracles that is daemonic and strange, but also integral to his identity. Central to my reading is the figure of the symptom, through which madness materializes onstage. Symptoms were contested sites of interpretation in the late fifth century, supporting both conventional narratives about human suffering and new stories advanced by contemporary medicine and ethics. In exploring the imaginative possibilities of these new stories, I do not privilege a “secular” over a “divine” reading. Rather I aim to offer a model of interaction between medicine and tragedy that sees the cross-breeding of worldviews as productive of innovative drama.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Music transcription is a process of creating a notation of musical sounds. It has been used as a basis for the analysis of music from a wide variety of cultures. Recent decades have seen an increasing amount of engineering research within the field of Music Information Retrieval that aims at automatically obtaining music transcriptions in Western staff notation. However, such approaches are not widely applied in research in ethnomusicology. This article aims to bridge interdisciplinary gaps by identifying aspects of proximity and divergence between the two fields. As part of our study, we collected manual transcriptions of traditional dance tune recordings by eighteen transcribers. Our method employs a combination of expert and computational evaluation of these transcriptions. This enables us to investigate the limitations of automatic music transcription (AMT) methods and computational transcription metrics that have been proposed for their evaluation. Based on these findings, we discuss promising avenues to make AMT more useful for studies in the Humanities. These are, first, assessing the quality of a transcription based on an analytic purpose; secondly, developing AMT approaches that are able to learn conventions concerning the transcription of a specific style; thirdly, a focus on novice transcribers as users of AMT systems; and, finally, considering target notation systems different from Western staff notation.},

  abstract = {This study examines the consistency of medieval abbreviation practices in a parallel corpus consisting of Latin and Middle English copies of a plague treatise attributed to John of Burgundy (JB). Focusing on different versions of the treatise enables us to maximize textual and lexical overlap, comparing differences caused by text type, word type, and language. We examine how the following variables affect the consistency of abbreviating across manuscript witnesses: A language: Latin versus English; B text type: recipes versus running text; C word type: lexical versus function words; and D: the number of characters in a word. Variables A–D are compared using a parallel corpus of automatically aligned rich TEI P5 XML-tagged transcriptions of six manuscript witnesses to the JB treatise. The alignment process is based on computer–human collaboration and custom-built alignment tool which uses sections tagged in the TEI XML file and word division. The results reveal that abbreviation was overwhelmingly more consistent in Latin than in the Middle English and somewhat more consistent in recipes. High token counts of frequent lexical items had a major effect on the results. Word length worked better than division into lexical and function words.},

This reading demonstrates how the work’s unique autobiographical prose functions to playfully advertise Florus’ special status as (frustrated) poet-turned-grammaticus, and to dramatize his flourishing contributions to Latin literary culture in provincial Spain—despite having been thwarted by a tyrannical princeps.},

  abstract = {In his celebrated quasi-bucolic episode of the first part of               Don Quixote               , Cervantes mocks and parodies the old school of the               Frauendienst               , even as he levels his irony against a chivalric ideal that had come under increasing scorn since at least the end of the fifteenth century. Various elements are blended to achieve his story. Grisóstomo's suicide turns out to be incontrovertible as well as illustrative of the essentially Petrarchan though parodical character of the famous poem “La cancion desesperada,” while the generally bucolic although mixed and burlesque quality of the entire episode issues straight from a central theme of the Renaissance pastoral, the whole matter of man's freedom. The very term “canción desesperada,” and probably other features of the long poem in Ch. xiv, derive directly from a sixteenth-century bucolic poet and fervent Petrarchist, Gutierre de Cetina.},

  abstract = {It is widely agreed that Thucydides’ Melian dialogue presents the Athenian invasion of Melos, and the Athenian justification, in a negative light. Attention tends to focus on the immorality of ‘the rule of the stronger’ that the Athenians present in the dialogue. This essay argues that another feature of the dialogue triggering negative judgements of the Athenians is their criticism of the Melians’ resistance: it is voiced by the Athenians themselves and therefore provokes in readers a ‘speakerrelative’ normative judgement of the Athenians. Philosophers have explored how our normative judgements about statements often depend on the speaker. Because the Athenians have deliberately put the Melians into their perilous situation, and because part of Athenian self-mythology was heroic resistance against overwhelming numbers in the Persian Wars, Athenian criticism of the Melians is hypocritical and applies an asymmetrical ethics to the Athenians and the Melians. Reaction against these features of the dialogue exacerbates the moral abhorrence of the Athenians felt by many readers. Hence I disagree with Bosworth’s view of the dialogue as primarily critical of the Melians. Instead we see Thucydides here condemning not only the Athenian imperial project but also the rhetoric used to defend and sustain it.},

  abstract = {As a part of the series on female deities and demons in the Indo-European culture, the article begins by establishing Helen’s divine character in the Greek tradition and religion. The first area where the Indo-European character of Helen is displayed concerns the etymology of her name, which has been the subject of discussion and controversy throughout several decades. The most prominent theories are presented, including the concept of Pokorny and West to explain her name as ‘Lady of Light’ from the Proto-Indo-European root *swel- or *swelh1-, the idea of Skutsch to connect Helen with Vedic Saṛanyū, the etymology by Clader relying on the local Greek ritual practices and finally the new etymology provided by Pinault explaining the name as ‘having a year like a thread’ from Proto-Indo-European *suh1-l̥-h1eno. The second part of the article deals with the cultural, literary and religious attributes of Helen which connect her with the Indo-European world, especially with the Vedic tradition. The most interesting aspects include the issue of Helen’s parenthood and her birth, her relationship with her brothers – the Dioskouroi – the prototypical Indo-European Divine Twins, as well as similarities with Vedic goddesses Uṣās – Dawn and Sūryā́ – the Sun Princess. The final part of the article establishes Helen as the Greek representation of the Indo-European myth of an abducted wife. Relying heavily on the analysis of Jamison, it draws on the similarities between the passages in the book III of the Mahābhārata and the book III of the Iliad, which from the comparative perspective explains well the inclusion of this scene in the Homeric epic and Helen’s role in it as well as sheds more light on the Indo-European practices regarding marriage. Lastly, the article mentions a connection between Helen and Vedic Saṛanyū by the story of eidolon – a phantom, which both characters created at certains points in some literary traditions.},

  abstract = {Drawing on Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz’s monadological metaphysics, with its nominalist emphasis on the integrity of the individual, the eminent Dutch philosopher of history Franklin Rudolf Ankersmit proposes a radically new interpretation of the way historical representations create “historical reality” based on the “death” of the no longer actual past. Representation: The Birth of Historical Reality from the Death of the Past is an unapologetically baroque exercise that seeks to fashion a unified argument by drawing on the most diverse of elements. Gilles Deleuze’s emphasis on the importance of the “fold” in his study of Leibniz and the baroque gives us an insight into the origami figure that results, a figure that is circular, closed on itself, and impermeable. After attempting to reconstruct the logic of Ankersmit’s convoluted argument, this review article raises questions about his claim that the past can ever be unequivocally “dead,” his reliance on Leibniz’s “principle of sufficient reason” to justify “historical rationality,” and his hope that historicism can be revived on the basis of a monadological metaphysics.},

These tests are performed using two separate feature sets: a ‘‘raw’’ feature set containing all words and word bigrams that are common to all of the authors, and a second ‘‘pre-processed’’ feature set derived by reducing the raw feature set to include only words meeting a minimum relative frequency threshold. Each of the methods tested performed well, but nearest shrunken centroids and regularized discriminant analysis had the best overall performances with 0/70 cross-validation errors.},

  abstract = {Reproducibility has become a requirement in the hard sciences, and its adoption is gradually extending to the digital humanities. The FAIR criteria and the publication of data papers are both indicative of this trend. However, the question that arises is whether the strict prerequisites of digital reproducibility serve only to exclude digital humanities from broader humanities scholarship. Instead of adopting a binary approach, an alternative method acknowledges the unique features of the objects, inquiries, and techniques of the humanities, including digital humanities, as well as the social and historical contexts in which the concept of reproducibility has developed in the human sciences. In the first part of this paper, I propose to examine the historical and disciplinary context in which the concept of reproducibility has developed within the human sciences, and the disciplinary struggles involved in this process, especially for art history and literature studies. In the second part, I will explore the question of reproducibility through two art history research projects that utilize various computational methods. I argue that issues of corpus, method, and interpretation cannot be separated, rendering a procedural definition of reproducibility impractical. Consequently, I propose the adoption of ‘post-computational reproducibility’, which is based on FAIREST criteria as far as digital corpora are concerned (FAIR\,+\,Ethics and Expertise, Source mention\,+\,Time-Stamp), but extended to include further sources that confirm computational results with other non-computational methodologies.},

We describe its various salient features with special reference to those of its features that may help the philologist digitize commentaries and sub-commentaries on a text. This tool captures the historical evolution of a text through various temporal stages, and interrelated data culled from various types of related texts. We use the text of the Kāśikāvṛtti (KV) as a sample text, and with the help of philologists, we digitize the commentaries available to us. We digitize the Nyāsa (Ny), the Padamañjarī (Pm) and sub-commentaries on the KV text known as the Tantrapradīpa (Tp), and the Makaranda (Mk). We divide each commentary and sub-commentary into functional units and describe the methodology and motivation behind the functional unit division. Our functional unit division helps generate more accurate phylogenetic trees for the text, based on distance methods using the data entered in the tool.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been found that monolingual English language models can be used as knowledge bases. Instead of structural knowledge base queries, masked sentences such as “Paris is the capital of [MASK]” are used as probes. We translate the established benchmarks TREx and GoogleRE into 53 languages. Working with mBERT, we investigate three questions. (i) Can mBERT be used as a multilingual knowledge base? Most prior work only considers English. Extending research to multiple languages is important for diversity and accessibility. (ii) Is mBERT’s performance as knowledge base language-independent or does it vary from language to language? (iii) A multilingual model is trained on more text, e.g., mBERT is trained on 104 Wikipedias. Can mBERT leverage this for better performance? We find that using mBERT as a knowledge base yields varying performance across languages and pooling predictions across languages improves performance. Conversely, mBERT exhibits a language bias; e.g., when queried in Italian, it tends to predict Italy as the country of origin.},

Bottiger in 1775, and up to its conceptualization in contemporary and feminist scholarship. This section concludes with a statement on the historiographical inadequacy of this research question, and suggests that a historiographically appropriate formulation must be based on a reconsideration of the ideology which informed the initial constitution of the research issue.},

This article, written collaboratively by an education scholar and a drag queen involved in organizing DQSH, contextualizes the programme within the landscape of gender in education as well as within the world of drag, and argues that Drag Queen Story Hour provides a generative extension of queer pedagogy into the world of early childhood education. Drawing on the work of Jos e Esteban Mun\textasciitilde oz, the authors discuss five interrelated elements of DQSH that offer early childhood educators a way into a sense of queer imagination: play as praxis, aesthetic transformation, strategic defiance, destigmatization of shame, and embodied kinship. Ultimately, the authors propose that “drag pedagogy” provides a performative approach to queer pedagogy that is not simply about LGBT lives, but living queerly.},

Inspired by rhizomatic models of classical reception studies, my reading focuses on the relationship between classical references in the body of the poems, on the one hand, and classical references in the paratexts on the other hand. I argue that Youn’s oblique engagement with classical material exposes the limitations of an arborescent or genealogical model of reception and, on a related note, the constraints imposed by the construct of the canon as Youn leverages the heterogeneity of Asian American literature to resist the idea of a simple, hierarchical, one-way classical canon.},

  abstract = {Conversion has played a central role in the history of Christianity. In this first in-depth and wide-ranging narrative history, David W. Kling examines the dynamic of individuals, families, and people groups who turn to the Christian faith. Global in reach, this book progresses from early Christian beginnings in the Roman world to Christianity’s expansion into Europe, the Americas, China, India, and Africa. Although conversion is often associated with a particular strand of modern Christianity (evangelical) and a particular type of experience (sudden, overwhelming), it is, when examined over two millennia, a phenomenon far more complex than any one-dimensional profile would suggest. No single, unitary paradigm defines conversion, and no easily demonstrable process accounts for why people convert to Christianity. Rather, a multiplicity of factors—historical, personal, social, geographical, theological, psychological, and cultural—shape the converting process.               A History of Christian Conversion               not only narrates the conversions of select individuals and peoples. It also engages current theories and models to explain conversion and examines recurring themes in the converting process: gender, agency, motivation, testimony, coercion, self-identity, “true” conversion, music, communication, the body, and divine presence. Accessible to scholars, students, and those with a general interest in conversion, Kling’s book is, to date, the most satisfying and comprehensive account of conversion in Christian history; this major work will become a standard must-read in conversion studies.},

  abstract = {The relationship between poetically mediated myth and the emerging discipline of formal rhetoric in fifth-and fourth-century Athens has received little scholarly treatment, in part because of a paucity of texts that encompass both myth and formal rhetoric. This article sheds light on the relationship by examining four generically hybrid model speeches: Gorgias' Defense of Palamedes, Antisthenes' Ajax and Odysseus, and Alcidamas' Odysseus. I argue that these speeches represent a rare confluence of the Archaic poetic tradition with the inclination towards technique-based modes of discourse among the sophists.This innovative didactic strategy, whereby rhetoric appropriates the appeal of poetic storytelling and characterization, has affinities with a broader societal and literary trend toward mixing genres.},

The author utilised qualitative data analysis, document vectors produced through topic modelling, and Classics domain knowledge to distil three numeric scores for philosophical text in Ancient Greek. One measures “good and virtue”, while the second score measures “scientific inquiry”, and the third combines the two to measure “philosophicalness”. The scores are applicable to passages, works, and workgroups within the corpus and not only performed well in identifying works by philosophers but also identified passages by non-philosophers containing philosophical components. Thus, this method represents a widely applicable, scalable, and unbiased way to find research-relevant passages in a corpus that is too large to be read in its entirety.},

It suggests further that the episode is a deliberate rejoinder to the conflict between Achilles and Agamemnon, as described in the Iliad, and is intended to show how properly to resolve a clash between a king and his more warlike subordinate.},

  abstract = {Contextual language models have been trained on Classical languages, including Ancient Greek and Latin, for tasks such as lemmatization, morphological tagging, part of speech tagging, authorship attribution, and detection of scribal errors. However, high-quality sentence embedding models for these historical languages are significantly more difficult to achieve due to the lack of training data. In this work, we use a multilingual knowledge distillation approach to train BERT models to produce sentence embeddings for Ancient Greek text. The state-of-the-art sentence embedding approaches for high-resource languages use massive datasets, but our distillation approach allows our Ancient Greek models to inherit the properties of these models while using a relatively small amount of translated sentence data. We build a parallel sentence dataset using a sentence-embedding alignment method to align Ancient Greek documents with English translations, and use this dataset to train our models. We evaluate our models on translation search, semantic similarity, and semantic retrieval tasks and investigate translation bias. We make our training and evaluation datasets freely available at this url.},

Each speech corresponds to stages in the development of her role, and their dialectic of ignorance and knowledge, action and reaction, demonstrates the interconnection between action and narration. In each speech, Deianeira promotes an aspect of the plot, while at the same time assuring the gradual progression of her own course towards death. Thus, the unfolding action becomes identical with the unfolding of the heroine's personal story.},

Attempts are currently being made by arguing that computational methods are at the same time hermeneutic procedures (‘screwmeneutics’, ‘hermenumericals’): computation and hermeneutics were mixed. In criticizing this fusion of ‘literacy’ and ‘numeracy’, it is argued that what really connects the classical Humanities and the Digital Humanities is methodologically based on the ‘cultural technique of flattening’ and not on hermeneutics. The projection of spatial and non-spatial relations onto the artificial flatness of inscribed and illustrated surfaces forms a first-order epistemic and cultural potential in the history of the Humanities: diagrammatic reasoning, the visualizing potential of writings, lists, tables, diagrams, and maps, the sorting function of alphabetically ordered knowledge corpora have always shaped and determined basic scholarly work. It is this ‘diagrammatical’ dimension to which the Digital Humanities are linked to Humanities in general. The metamorphosis of texts, pictures, and music into the surface configurations of machine-analyzable data corpora opens up the possibility of revealing latent and implicit patterns of cultural artifacts, and practices that mostly are not accessible to human perception. The quantifying, computational methods of the Digital Humanities operate like computer-generated microscopes and telescopes into the cultural heritage, ongoing cultural practices, and even the culturally unconscious.},

We frame this from a communication perspective—media are increasingly central sites for constructing and conveying the identity of candidates and the groups of constituents they seek to represent. In developing this model, we seek to bring this identity-based framework more to the fore in communication research, as well as place communication at the center of studies of social identity. We argue that seeing political identities as dynamic and actively performed provides an opportunity to analyze communications based not only on their informational value but also on their identity value.},

Boccaccio was interested in these discussions because humanists were promoting classicizing tragic and epic literatures at the expense of vernacular writing. This article explores Boccaccio’s role in these debates by examining the tragic stories of the Decameron. It suggests that Boccaccio highlighted the virtues of his erotic tales by contrasting them to the tragic stories of day 4, a strategy inspired by Ovid’s elegiac poems. Boccaccio thus underscored the dignity of his low, Ovidian-inspired Decameron, and counterbalanced humanist fascination with high tragic-epic literatures.},

Although Copjec is correct that orthodox film theory misrepresents the Lacanian gaze, she, in turn, misrepresents Foucault by choosing to focus exclusively upon those aspects of his work on the panopticon that have been taken up by orthodox film theory (Copjec 1994: 4). In so doing, I argue, Copjec misses key parallels between the Lacanian and Foucauldian concepts of the gaze. More than a narrow academic dispute about how to read Foucault and Lacan, this debate has wider political significance. In particular, using Slavoj Žižek’s work, I show that a correct account of the panoptic gaze leads us to rethink the question of how to oppose modern techniques of surveillance.},

With rising concerns about their potential misuse, there is a pressing need for AI-generated-text forensics. Neural authorship attribution is a forensic effort, seeking to trace AIgenerated text back to its originating LLM. The LLM landscape can be divided into two primary categories: proprietary and open-source. In this work, we delve into these emerging categories of LLMs, focusing on the nuances of neural authorship attribution. To enrich our understanding, we carry out an empirical analysis of LLM writing signatures, highlighting the contrasts between proprietary and open-source models, and scrutinizing variations within each group. By integrating stylometric features across lexical, syntactic, and structural aspects of language, we explore their potential to yield interpretable results and augment pre-trained language model-based classifiers utilized in neural authorship attribution. Our findings, based on a range of state-ofthe-art LLMs, provide empirical insights into neural authorship attribution, paving the way for future investigations aimed at mitigating the threats posed by AI-generated misinformation.},

This model is presented alongside several philological analyses of patterns both large and small. Foundational descriptive statistics and corresponding datasets for both the text and meter of the Homeric corpus constitute another significant contribution of this project; these elements can be found in Chapters 1 and 3, respectively. The model of formulaic language and sample analyses are in Chapter 2. Chapter 4 presents a long-form philological argument about the role of passage repetitions in Homeric epic. Chapter 5 includes a complete codebook and documentation for each dataset. This dissertation offers new data, new methods, and new models to traditional philological practices.},

  abstract = {"This volume, edited by Natasha Constantinidou and Han Lamers, investigates modes of receiving and responding to Greeks, Greece, and Greek in early modern Europe (15th-17th centuries). The book's 17 detailed studies illuminate the reception of Greek culture (the classical, Byzantine, and even post-Byzantine traditions), the Greek language (ancient, vernacular, and 'humanist'), as well as the people claiming, or being assigned, Greek identities during this period in different geographical and cultural contexts. Discussing subjects as diverse as, for example, Greek studies and the Reformation, artistic interchange between Greek East and Latin West, networks of communication in the Greek diaspora, and the ramifications of Greek antiquarianism, the book aims at encouraging a more concerted debate about the role of Hellenism in early modern Europe that goes beyond disciplinary boundaries, and opening ways towards a more over-arching understanding of this multifaceted cultural phenomenon. Contributors include Aslıhan Akışık-Karakullukçu, Michele Bacci, Malika Bastin-Hammou, Peter Bell, Michail Chatzidakis, Federica Ciccolella, Calliope Dourou, Anthony Ellis, Niccolò Fattori, Maria Luisa Napolitano, Janika Päll, Luigi-Alberto Sanchi, Niketas Siniossoglou, William Stenhouse, Paola Tomè, Raf Van Rooy, and Stefan Weise"--},

  abstract = {Greek new comedy is infused with characters on the move, whether they be mercenaries, traders, economic migrants, refugees, or the many and various victims of trafficking (slave and free). While it is unclear exactly how closely comic mobility tracks historical circumstances, mobility in and out of Athens was certainly more frequent in the later part of the fourth century. Witnessing free and enslaved others—both in comedy and in culture—forced to contend with the consequences of migration and displacement gave audience members new opportunities to perceive and respond to the newly relocated and the dispossessed, and to take a closer look at their own circumstances and perceptual processes. This study investigates the way comedy brings the precarities faced by female economic migrants into view, and what this reveals about gender, freedom, and cultural frames, using Menander's               Dis Exapaton               with Plautus’               Bacchides               as test cases.},

I propose that this view becomes less convincing when the optative’s unique interaction with the subjective particles ἦ and ἄρα is incorporated into the analysis. Rather, the potential optative has a non-subjective epistemic semantics presenting an epistemic judgment as interpersonally accessible to the conversational participants. Frequencies of combination with ἦ and ἄρα, linguistic tests for subjectivity on the potential optative, and contrastive contextual analyses corroborate this view.},

Hence, an effort to describe a relation with agency that focuses not on their characters (humans or nonhumans, animated or deanimated) but rather on their common source. This source is recognized here—both semiotically and then ontologically—as a “metaphorphic zone.” It is just such a common articulation that could allow speaking with and about former “facts of nature” in a different way, a way better adjusted to the new political situation.},

From image classification to optical character recognition, the effects of decisions ostensibly made by machines compound through the digitization pipeline and redouble in each step, mediating our interactions with digitally-rendered artifacts through the search and discovery process. As a result, scholars within the digital humanities community have begun advocating for the proper contextualization of cultural heritage datasets within the socio-technical systems in which they are created and utilized. One such approach to this contextualization is the data archaeology, a form of humanistic excavation of a dataset that Paul Fyfe defines as “recover[ing] and reconstitut[ing] media objects within their changing ecologies” [Fyfe 2016]. Within critical data studies, this excavation of a dataset - including its construction and mediation via machine learning - has proven to be a capacious approach. However, the data archaeology has yet to be adopted as standard practice among cultural heritage practitioners who produce such datasets with machine learning.},

  abstract = {In recent years, large Transformer-based Pre-trained Language Models (PLM) have changed the Natural Language Processing (NLP) landscape, by pushing the performance boundaries of the stateof-the-art on a wide variety of tasks. However, this performance gain goes along with an increase in complexity, and as a result, the size of such models (up to billions of parameters) represents a constraint for their deployment on embedded devices or short-inference time tasks. To cope with this situation, compressed models emerged (e.g. DistilBERT), democratizing their usage in a growing number of applications that impact our daily lives. A crucial issue is the fairness of the predictions made by both PLMs and their distilled counterparts. In this paper, we propose an empirical exploration of this problem by formalizing two questions: (1) Can we identify the neural mechanism(s) responsible for gender bias in BERT (and by extension DistilBERT)? (2) Does distillation tend to accentuate or mitigate gender bias (e.g. is DistilBERT more prone to gender bias than its uncompressed version, BERT)? Our findings are the following: (I) one cannot identify a specific layer that produces bias; (II) every attention head uniformly encodes bias; except in the context of underrepresented classes with a high imbalance of the sensitive attribute; (III) this subset of heads is different as we re-fine tune the network; (IV) bias is more homogeneously produced by the heads in the distilled model.},

In the present study, in contrast, I investigate the transmission of targeted information, news relevant to a circumscribed number of individuals, such as one household. I maintain that targeted reports were delivered thanks to an institution of informal reportage which was based on a quid pro quo between news-bringers and recipients. Unlike formal messengers, informal messengers voluntarily reported ex tempore alongside their other engagements in order to be compensated. This cultural environment enabled an efficient mechanism for reportage; it was likewise, however, a fertile ground for the circulation of misinformation.},

  abstract = {Heracles' image in antiquity is notoriously kaleidoscopic. Comedy represented him as a gluttonous buffoon, and myth made no secret of the brutal violence of many of his exploits. On the other hand, Pindar exalts him as a superlative figure who enforced the               nomos               of the gods, while Prodicus in a famous myth makes Heracles a supreme example of commendable conduct, a youth who chooses the path of Virtue over the path of Vice out of his own free will. This image of a moralized Heracles soon took root in the Greek imagination, and a whole host of Greek thinkers (Isocrates, Antisthenes, Diogenes the Cynic, and Plutarch, to name but a few) found in him a perfectly malleable               exemplum               for their various courses in moral edification. After undergoing a large number of transformations in Roman literature and the Church Fathers, Heracles resurfaces unscathed in the early Renaissance, when we find him again as an already established               exemplum virtutis               , now a man of letters, now a Christian. It would appear that, despite his multifarious metamorphoses, Heracles remained throughout the centuries essentially what he had been since Prodicus' day: an exemplary figure who undertook extreme toils and gained supreme recompense.},

  abstract = {We have built a suite of tools in Python to proficiently analyze text reuse and intertextuality for a specific kind of set of medieval Arabic texts (commentaries) available in print. We take these printed editions, scan them, pre-process the images, give it to an OCR engine, clean the results, and store it in a data structure that mimics the explicit intertextual relation the texts have, and continue to perform data analysis on it. Digital approaches to medieval Arabic texts have either been at the micro-level in what has become known as a ‘digital edition’, i.e.~the digital representation of one text, densely annotated, most commonly in TEI-XML, or it has been done at the macro-level in what is called a ‘digital corpus’, consisting of thousands of loosely encoded and sparsely annotated plain text files, accompanied by an entire infrastructure and high-performing software to perform broadly scoped queries. The micro-level generally is at the level of tens of thousands of words while the macro-level can be at the level of over a billion words. The micro-level is explicitly designed to be human readable first, while the macro-level is built to be machine readable first. At the micro-level, every little detail needs to be correct and in order, while at the macro-level a fairly large margin of error is still negligible as a mere rounding error. Amidst these levels we have been seeking a meso-level of digital analysis: neither edition nor corpus, but rather a group of texts at the level of hundreds of thousands to millions of words, with a small but perceptible margin of error, and a light but noticeable level of annotations, principally geared towards machine readability, but with ample opportunity for visual inspection and manual correction. In this paper we explain the rationale for our approach, the technical achievements it has led us to, and the results we so far obtained.},

We find that BERT was significantly undertrained, and can match or exceed the performance of every model published after it. Our best model achieves state-of-the-art results on GLUE, RACE and SQuAD. These results highlight the importance of previously overlooked design choices, and raise questions about the source of recently reported improvements. We release our models and code.},

La figura de Estesícoro y de sus poemas sobre Helena de Esparta sirven al escritor italiano, en primer lugar, para justificar, casi en términos autobiográficos, el primer poema difamatorio sobre Helena del poeta griego y la obligada palinodia para restituir la honorabilidad de la espartana. También sirve, en segundo lugar, para perpetuar la figura de Helena como mito erótico en este relato policíaco, protagonizado por una cohorte de pretendientes de Helena, personaje apenas visible en el relato. Por último, el autor hibrida el mito erótico clásico con el tópico cristiano               noli me tangere               , con el sorprendente resultado de que esta idea suaviza el erotismo inherente al mito de Helena, y el mito de Helena impregna de complicidad íntima la relación entre Jesús y María Magdalena.                        ,              Abstract                            This paper analyses Andrea Camilleri’s use of poems allegedly written by the Greek poet Stesichorus, to develop a detective plot in the novel               Noli me tangere               . The figure of Stesichorus and his poems about Helen of Sparta serve the Italian writer, firstly, to justify, almost in autobiographical terms, the Greek poet’s first slanderous poem about Helen and the obligatory palinode to restore Helen’s honour. Secondly, it also serves to perpetuate the figure of Helen as an erotic myth in this detective story, starring a cohort of Helen’s suitors, a character who is barely visible in the story. Finally, the author hybridises the classical erotic myth with the Christian trope               noli me tangere               , with the surprising result that this idea softens the eroticism inherent in the myth of Helen, and the myth of Helen imbues the relationship between Jesus and Mary Magdalene with intimate complicity.},

  abstract = {ResumenLa autora introduce al lector en la sociofenomenología de la vida cotidiana de A. Schütz desde una lectura hermenéutica de “El Quijote”. Se detiene en el análisis schütziano de las estructuras de relevancias presentes en el universo quijotesco, ilustrando con citas de la obra de Cervantes y comentarios de las mismas las diversas construcciones sociales de los mundos de la vida habitados por los diferentes personajes, principalmente por Don Quijote y Sancho. Las articulaciones de estas realidades múltiples van aclarando el sentido del subuniverso quijotesco y el lugar del mismo en el seno del mundo de la vida compartido. Esas articulaciones se traducen en diferentes relaciones intersubjetivas que van reconfigurando el mundo social de don Quijote. A modo de conclusión, la autora reinterpreta la “locura” quijotesca de acuerdo con la estructura de relevancias.Palabras clavesociofenomenología, Schütz, mundo de la vida, D. QuijoteAbstractAutor initiates reader into A. Schütz´s Sociophenomenology of the daily life by means of the phenomenological hermeneutics of “The Quixot”. She focusses on the schützian analysis of the structures of relevances in the quixotic universe. The different social constructions of the lifeworlds are illustrated through Cervantes book´s quotations and comments, mainly by the D. Quixot and Sancho inhabited worlds. The articulations of these multiple realities go clarifying the sense of the quixotic subuniverse and its place in the common lifeworld´s bossom. Such articulations are translated into different intersubjetive relationships which reshape the Quixot´s social world. As a conclusion, author reinterpretes the quixotic “madness” in line with the structure of the relevances.KeywordsSociophenomenology, Schütz, Lifeworld, D. Quixot},

The Routledge Companion to Phenomenology is an outstanding guide and reference source to the key philosophers, topics and themes in this exciting subject, and essential reading for any student or scholar of phenomenology. Comprising over fifty chapters by a team of international contributors, the Companion is divided into five clear parts: • main figures in the phenomenological movement, from Brentano to Derrida • main topics in phenomenology • phenomenological contributions to philosophy • phenomenological intersections • historical postscript. Close attention is paid to the core topics in phenomenology such as intentionality, perception, subjectivity, the self, the body, being and phenomenological method. An important feature of the Companion is its examination of how phenomenology has contributed to central disciplines in philosophy such as metaphysics, philosophy of mind, moral philosophy, aesthetics and philosophy of religion as well as disciplines beyond philosophy such as race, cognitive science, psychiatry, literary criticism and psychoanalysis},

Taking as its prompt the riposte of Alain Badiou, ‘Nietzsche is miles away from any doctrine of dance as a primitive ecstasy’ and ‘dance is in no way the liberated bodily impulse, the wild energy of the body’, the essay uncovers the ties between dance and Apollo in the Nietzschean theory of art while qualifying dance’s relation to Dionysus. Primarily through an analysis of The Dionysiac World View and The Birth of Tragedy, the essay seeks to illuminate enigmatic statements about dance in Nietzsche (‘in dance the greatest strength is only potential, although it is betrayed by the suppleness of movement’ and ‘dance is the preservation of orderly measure’). It does this through an elucidation of the specific function of dance in Nietzsche’s interpretation of classical Greece; via an assessment of the difficulties associated with the Nietzschean understanding of the bacchanal; and lastly through an analysis of Nietzsche’s characterization of dance as a symbol. The essay culminates in a discussion of dance’s ties to Nietzschean life affirmation; here the themes of physico-phenomenal existence, joy and illusion in Nietzsche are surveyed.},

Taken jointly, these articles offer the first account of the use of notation keys in the Hellenistic musical documents that is fully consistent with technical evidence as well as literary testimonies about the harmonic innovations of the New Musicians. This article offers practical analyses and new modern transcriptions of the Ashmolean Papyri (DAGM 5–6) and Athenaeus’ Paean (DAGM 20) – scores that reflect the modulation system of the New Music and its characteristic use of ‘exharmonic’ and ‘chromatic’ notes. The analyses offered in this article are powered by a newlydeveloped database (dDAGM) and show that these seemingly ‘exharmonic’ notes correspond to the chromatic ‘bends’ first identified in Lynch 2018a. These ‘bends’ (kampaí) ‘distorted’ the central pillars of the noble Dorian harmonía and turned it into its polar opposite: the Mixolydian, the emotional and lamenting mode par excellence.},

But do those sentences mean something, or are LMs simply babbling in a convincing simulacrum of language use? Here we will address one aspect of this broad question: whether LMs' words can refer, that is, achieve "word-to-world" connections. There is prima facie reason to think they do not since LMs do not interact with the world in the way that ordinary language users do. Drawing on insights from the externalist tradition in philosophy of language, we argue that those appearances are misleading: even if the inputs to an LM are simply strings of text, they are strings of text with natural histories, and that may suffice to put LMs' words into referential contact with the external world.},

  abstract = {In recent years, one of the two fully preserved ancient Greek tragic plays of disputed authorship, Rhesus, traditionally attributed to Euripides, has been the object of a quite lively scholarly interest. The rather extreme number, for the standards of classical philology, of four published commentaries in 10 years, by Athanasios D. Stefanis, [Euripides’]: Rhesus, Athens: Academy of Athens, 2004, Arne Feickert, Euripidis: Rhesus, Frankfurt: Lang, 2005, Vayos Liapis, A Commentary on the Rhesus Attributed to Euripides, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012, and Almut Fries, Pseudo-Euripides: Rhesus, Berlin: De Gruyter, 2014 (two of them in English), and one forthcoming by Marco Fantuzzi (also in English), tangibly prove the great vogue this drama enjoys nowadays. Its doubtful nature, as far as the fusion of tragic and comic elements is concerned (see further Burnett, Directions in Euripidean Criticism: A Collection of Essays, Durham: Duke University Press, pp. 13–51, 177–88, 1985), and, most of all, its controversial authorship and date still render it a riddle—even though its non-Euripidean origin is widely accepted. Our research is an attempt to unveil the authorial status of this play, employing traditional and non-traditional authorship attribution techniques. In fact, as it will become clear in the course of this work, the latter kind of methodology allows us to approach the author of Rhesus in a way that was not even thought possible until the present day.},

In contrast, word usage in early and late plays by Sophocles does not differ. This makes it unlikely that the Iliad and Odyssey are early and late works by the same author. Word usage in poems with very different subject matter ascribed to Hesiod does not differ. This makes it unlikely that differences between the Iliad and the Odyssey can be attributed to the differing subject matter of the two poems. Further support for the contention that the Iliad and Odyssey are the works of different poets comes from the finding that word usage in the two poems is much more different than word usage in plays known to be by Aeschylus, Sophocles, and Euripides. Discriminant analyses of putatively early and late segments of the Iliad and Odyssey generally yielded insignificant results, thus implying that each could well be the work of a single poet.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have impressive capabilities, but are prone to outputting falsehoods. Recent work has developed techniques for inferring whether a LLM is telling the truth by training probes on the LLM’s internal activations. However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we use high-quality datasets of simple true/false statements to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM’s forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa. Overall, we present evidence that at sufficient scale, LLMs linearly represent the truth or falsehood of factual statements. We also show that simple difference-in-mean probes generalize as well as other probing techniques while identifying directions which are more causally implicated in model outputs.},

The amoebaeon, as preserved, is not interpretable however: the repetition of the second ephymnion (lines 1513–20) is intrusive, and it prevents the audience from appreciating Aeschylus’s musical structure. Further, lines 1513–20 do not conform to Aeschylus’s use of refrains elsewhere. Interpretability is restored if this passage is deleted.},

However, language is portrayed as failing on all levels: from mere articulation to agreement about the meaning of words and to cooperation in conversation. At the same time, there seems to be a negative correlation between the production of articulated or even rhetorical utterances and the speakers’ achieving of their aims. This paper argues that in Philoctetes Sophocles illustrates the conditions and the social embeddedness of language use, transcending fifth-century philosophical and rhetorical approaches to the matter. The focus on language helps to reframe the conflict underlying the play, from being predominantly moral to being social in nature.},

  abstract = {A passage in Pindar’s Pythian 2, regarding the blame-poet Archilochus who serves as foil for the epinician speaker, can be better understood by comparisons, both with later Greek comic texts (e.g., the parabasis of Aristophanes’ Wasps) and with non-Greek satirical traditions (in medieval Ireland and among the Hausa of Northern Nigeria). In short, Archilochus is not presented as a starving poet. This explication of Pyth.2.52–56 further attempts to show how the influence of Callimachean aesthetic ideas concerning the “slender” style has obscured a more plausible reference to actual profit-making on the part of the master of iambos (something paralleled in the Aristophanic imaginary). In addition, the semantics of two key terms in the passage at hand — piainomai (“become fat”) and amakhania (“helplessness”) — are pinned down with more precision and argued to be of greater relevance for Pindar’s larger poetic project.},

  abstract = {In the tradition of studies concerning Vincent Ferrer, there have been substantial omissions that have only recently been dealt with (though partially). The characterisation of the work of the reportator and the subsequent editor of a particular sermon has been one of them. In this article, the role of these two figures –the reportator and the editor-reviser– is analysed through the sermon book containing Vincent Ferrer’s 1413 Lenten preaching in Valencia. On the basis of theoretical reflection, the formation of the codex that contains it is examined, in addition to the interventions unrelated to the preacher and some of the materials that might have been used by the writer during the work undertaken after the written reportatio. This article concludes with a hypothesis about the traits of the person or group responsible for the Lenten pages that can be read nowadays.},

  abstract = {In 1936, T. B. L. Webster argued that Sophocles'               Trachiniae               has strong allusions to Aeschylus'               Agamemnon               , particularly in the characters of Deianeira and Clytemnestra. Once identified, it is easy see: each kills her husband as he returns from battle, and in each case the death contains an element of entrapment. Heracles' poisoned robe indeed seems deliberately to reflect the famous net used to entrap Agamemnon: Heracles' description of it (οἷον τόδ᾽ ἡ δολῶπις Οἰνέως κόρη / καθῆψεν ὤμοις τοῖς ἐμοῖς Ἐρινύων / ὑϕαντὸν ἀμϕίβληστρον, ‘…this woven garment of the Erinyes which the treacherous daughter of Oineus fastened on my shoulders’;               Trachiniae               1050–2) is similar to Aegisthus' words near the end of               Agamemnon               (ἰδὼν ὑϕαντοῖς ἐν πέπλοις Ἐρινύων / τὸν ἄνδρα τόνδε κείμενον ϕίλως ἐμοί, ‘…seeing this man lying in robes of the Erinyes, to my joy’; 1580–1). Even if the direct verbal allusion fails to resonate with an audience, it seems unlikely, given the high level of audience competence, that audience members would not make the thematic connection. It is almost impossible to deny, therefore, that in Deianeira Sophocles was writing a deliberate response to Clytemnestra and contrasting the accidental murder caused by a loving wife with the carefully planned murder by a bitter wife.},

In 1799, Latassa claims to have seen it in the Archivo de la Librería del Real Convento de Predicadores. Owing to the authority of Latassa, this manuscript work by Fray de España continued to be mentioned by various historians interested in the historiography of science in Spain. However, until now very little has been known about its content and fate. The purpose of this note is to introduce this work by Juan de España to the academic community and announce its discovery in the Rare Books and Manuscripts Library (RBML) of The Ohio State University (OSU) Library in Columbus, OH.},

  abstract = {"The first female translator of the epic into English in over sixty years, Stephanie McCarter addresses accuracy in translation and its representation of women, gendered dynamics of power, and sexual violence in Ovid's classic. Ovid's Metamorphoses is an epic poem, but one that upturns almost every convention. There is no main hero, no central conflict, and no sustained objective. What it is about (power, defiance, art, love, abuse, grief, rape, war, beauty, and so on) is as changeable as the beings that inhabit its pages. The sustained thread is power and how it transforms us, both those of us who have it and those of us who do not. For those who are brutalized and traumatized, transformation is often the outward manifestation of their trauma. A beautiful virgin is caught in the gaze of someone more powerful who rapes or tries to rape them, and they ultimately are turned into a tree or a lake or a stone or a bird. The victim's objectification is clear: They are first a visual object, then a sexual object, and finally simply an object. Around 50 of the epic's tales involve rape or attempted rape of women. Past translations have obscured or mitigated Ovid's language so that rape appears to be consensual sex. Through her translation, McCarter considers the responsibility of handling sexual and social dynamics. Then why continue to read Ovid? McCarter proposes Ovid should be read because he gives us stories through which we can better explore ourselves and our world, and he illuminates problems that humans have been grappling with for millennia. Careful translation of rape and the body allows readers to see Ovid's nuances clearly and to better appreciate how ideas about sexuality, beauty, and gender are constructed over time. This is especially important since so many of our own ideas about these phenomena are themselves undergoing rapid metamorphosis, and Ovid can help us see and understand this progression. The Metamorphoses holds up a kaleidoscopic lens to the modern world, one that offers us the opportunity to reflect on contemporary discussions about gender, sexuality, race, violence, art, and identity"-- Provided by publisher},

This contrasts with the wealth of potential opportunities that could arise from closer collaborations. We argue that more efforts are needed to make NLP tools work for DH datasets so that that NLP research applied to humanities data receives more attention, leading to the development of evaluation approaches tailored towards relevant research questions. This has the potential to bring methodological advances to NLP, while at the same time confronting DH datasets with powerful state-of-the-art techniques.},

We approach this as an annotation task and introduce how our composite annotation scheme models knowledge transfers among characters. We present preliminary results and discuss the question of measuring inter-annotator agreement, the calculation of which is not yet standardised for this type of annotation. Finally, we showcase an analysis of the annotated knowledge transfers on Günderrode’s 1805 play, Udohla.},

  abstract = {This essay tries to develop a “black radical Kantianism”—that is, a Kantianism informed by the black experience in modernity. After looking briefly at socialist and feminist appropriations of Kant, I argue that an analogous black radical appropriation should draw on the distinctive social ontology and view of the state associated with the black radical tradition. In ethics, this would mean working with a (color-conscious rather than colorblind) social ontology of white persons and black sub-persons and then asking what respect for oneself and others would require under those circumstances. In political philosophy, it would mean framing the state as a Rassenstaat (a racial state) and then asking what measures of corrective justice would be necessary to bring about the ideal Rechtsstaat.},

  abstract = {This article explores several approaches to the problem of "character" in Shakespeare. It identifies a bi-plex archive of characterological models: actual-world dependent models, and those based on formal textual features, or conventions. It argues that much of what Shakespeare did with regard to character, in common with most Renaissance and much medieval European literature, was to adapt and recursively modify a fundamental convention of Ovidian characterization, namely, cognitive dissonance, or divided awareness of values (which is here called "split awareness"). That dissonance could be resolved at the level of rhetorical demonstration by invoking a strategy of rationalization. Moreover, this recursive convention is demonstrated to be (1) fundamental, (2) open (to further adaptations), and (3) absorbed into the later novel tradition. Ovid is thus seen to have cast a very long shadow over European literature. However, the basic Ovidian convention, split awareness, is also seen as a paradigm case of how a structural form can be embedded, and subsequently reembedded, in culture.},

  abstract = {This essay provides a thorough analysis of Bruce Robbins’s, Jonathan Kramnick’s, and John Guillory’s recent books on the state of the discipline of literary criticism. In spite of the otherwise vast differences between these books, the authors have three shared commitments. They assume that criticism (understood as the reading of literature) still remains the main focus of departments of literary study. They work with an overwhelmingly male canon of theorists. Although women are invoked as examples, men remain the thoughtleaders. They all ignore, neglect, or mischaracterize the concerns of philosophies investigating judgment, experience, and subjectivity. As a result, they present us with an image of a profession in which it is taboo to invoke ordinary experience as a starting point for investigations. By focusing on Robbins’s and Guillory’s response to Rita Felski’s The Limits of Critique (and thus to the phenomenon of postcritique), and by bringing out Kramnick’s commitment to positivism and formalism, I conclude that Robbins and Kramnick look to the past for salvation, whereas Guillory shows that the future is unlikely to be any different from the present. The effect of professionalization and disciplinary pressures make academic critics highly resistant to the new.},

Thanks to the schema's motor intentionality our bodies inhabit and appropriate space: our postures and perceptual fields are organised schematically when we move to realise our projects. Thus our lived bodies are ineliminably expressive in being both animated and outcome oriented through-and-through. Mooney also analyses the place of the work in the modern philosophical world, showing what Merleau-Ponty takes up from the Kantian and Phenomenological traditions and what he contributes to each. Casting a fresh light on his magnum opus, this book is essential reading for all those interested in the philosophy and phenomenology of the body"},

Throughout the drama methods of depicting the exposure of the oikos to potential harm evoke its frequent appearance in Athenian public performances including speeches, oaths, and spectacles. Particularly important in Heracles is the destruction of the physical house which embodies the vulnerability of the whole household: recurring language of the contemporary punishment of house-razing, kataskaphē, reflects the fraught relationship of Thebes to Heracles and his household.},

For Arendt, the “place in the world which makes opinions significant and actions effective” (2017, 387–88) is “the result of our common labor, the outcome of the human artifice” (2017, 393)—the shared practices and institutions that Wittgenstein calls “forms of life” (2009, 15). In this article, the authors argue that by exploring and critiquing “forms of life” literature can expand the range of activities we recognize as fostering “participatory sense-making” (De Jaegher and Di Paolo 2007, 465). The three literary provocations presented here—Callimachus’s “Hymn to Apollo,” Thomas Mann’s The Magic Mountain, and Margaret Atwood’s Alias Grace—all interrogate the situated interactions of “I’s” and “We’s” that instantiate the “participatory plurality” of the shared world.},

In fact, such metamorphosis allows the dramatist to present a hero who is brought down to the level of bestiality; moreover, an analysis reveals that Philoctetus has a definite affinity with Polyphemus. And yet, at the same time, Philoctetus shows some obvious resemblances with the god Hephaistos. These two series of borrowings, the one that transpires through Polyphemus, and the one that radiates from the figure of Hephaistos, seem indeed to dictate the stage representation of the characters and to shape the definition of the status of the tragic hero.},

  abstract = {All attempts at realizing Thucydides’ promise of ‘a possession for all time’ involve some degree of remaking: the translation of the text, at the least, but more commonly also processes of selection, decontextualization, simplification, and framing, as well as the development of an image of the author that legitimizes present-orientated readings. This is particularly obvious in the case of interpretations that present Thucydides as a conventional academic authority, where, however, the processes of remaking are largely suppressed or denied in the interests of claiming Thucydides’ authority―this is what he really meant―to support modern ideas. This paper explores the greater latitude available to those engaging with his work in fictional and dramatic contexts―the authors Anne Carson and Virginia Woolf, and theatrical stagings of the Melian Dialogue (even as an immersive interactive experience)―to suggest that these may in fact be a truer reflection of some aspects of the Thucydidean project.},

From the 1970s onward,               Antigone               in particular has also become a staple of feminist theory, both as a philosophical and political gesture               contra               Hegel and Lacan, but also in connection with post-structuralism. Conversely, the topic of kinship in Athenian drama has attracted comparatively little attention from classical philologists. As a consequence, theorists have often been more inclined to discuss the theme with reference to modern conceptual frameworks, rather than to Sophocles’ language itself.},

Analyzing the tonal content of pieces of music and observing them over time is thus informative about large-scale historical changes. In this study, we employ a computational model that formalizes music-theoretic conceptualizations of tonal space, and use it to infer the most likely interval distributions for pieces in a large corpus of music, represented as so-called ‘bags of tonal pitch classes’. Our results show that tonal interval relations become increasingly complex, that the interval of the perfect fifth dominates compositions for centuries, and that one can observe a stark increase in the usage of major and minor thirds during the 19th century, which coincides with the emergence of extended tonality. In complementing prior research on the historical evolution of tonality, our study thus demonstrates how example-based music theory can be informed by quantitative analyses of large corpora and computational models.},

  abstract = {Insidious uses of the gift and deadly objects in Sophocles’ tragedies This article looks at the gift of objects in Sophocles. Numerous objects can be found in the plays of the tragedian, and they serve many functions ; they can be deadly and, in the semantic context of the plot (war, ritual, funeral, for instance), they can carry important values for their owner. Beside these functions, the way the objects are given as a legacy, or as a gift is also significant. In Ajax on the one hand the gift of the sword leads to the death of the hero and on the other the gift of the shield signifies the transmission of the father’s heroic values to the son. In the Trachiniae the gift of the peplos in the context of the sacrifice and the bestial world is the answer to the «gift » of Iole by Heracles, fi rst to Deianeira then to Hyllos in the context of the wedding, as an «object » linked to the power or Eros. In Electra the gift of the facticious urn allows Orestes to unfold his identity and the urn represents the peak of the mise en abîme of tragic fi ction ; Clytemnestra’s offerings bring to light the opposition between language and non verbal signs. In Philoctetes the restitution of the bow to the hero puts an end to Ulysse’s trickery and echoes the previous gift by its fi rst owner, Heracles. These transactions, when deadly, are mostly linked to a trickery or a contrivance (μηχανή ) and are caracterized by a reciprocity (χάρις), which is false or unbalanced. In this context objects can be agents and express intentions which go beyond the action of the protagonists who handle them.},

These components feature in the three Iliadic speeches where Helen blames herself for the Trojan War and fantasizes about having died before she came to Troy. The interpretation of Helen as traumatized builds on past examinations of her character and offers an alternative to scholarship that views her as sexually motivated, manipulative, and responsible for the Trojan War.},

  abstract = {Aristophanes’s plays, unknown to the Latin Middle Ages, were recovered in Renaissance Italy at the dawn of the Quattrocento. Latin versions were the principal form in which Aristophanes was introduced into the high Latin culture of the Western world. Thanks to the humanist Latin translations of the plays, scholars gained access to the Greek text of Aristophanes, who figured prominently in the educational curriculum of the time. This study focuses on an unpublished and little-known Latin version of Aristophanes’s Nubes (‘The Clouds’), which is preserved in MS Vienna, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek, philos. et philol. gr. 204, of the mid-fifteenth century. The Greek text is accompanied by an interlinear translation into Latin, made by the Dominican friar and Professor of theology Alessandro da Otranto (1458). This previously neglected manuscript is especially interesting because of the Latin version it contains, since it appears to be among the first ever made of Aristophanes’s Nubes. In this paper, I examine and discuss the various translational strategies employed by Alessandro to make Aristophanes’s fifth-century BC text accessible to a fifteenth-century Latin readership. I also offer a semi-diplomatic edition of the unpublished Latin text.},

Pun               . 8.144–223) has long been a matter of debate. While many scholars have expressed doubts that it is by Silius and suggest rather that it is from the hands of a skilful humanist, it has not, up to this time, been possible to provide solid evidence to support their intuition. This paper not only re-examines the standard arguments for and against authenticity but brings the latest computational stylometric techniques to bear on the question. These analyses reveal that the style of the               Additamentum               differs in statistically significant terms from the rest of Silius’               Punica               .                                1},

  abstract = {This paper describes an update to the open-source Python implementation of the General Imposters method of authorship verification by Mike Kestemont et al. The new algorithm, called Bootstrap Distance Imposters (henceforth BDI), incorporates a key improvement introduced by Potha and Stamatatos, as well as introducing a novel method of bootstrapping that has several attractive properties when compared to the reference algorithm. Initially, we supply an updated version of the Kestemont et al. code (for Python 3.x) which incorporates the same basic improvements. Next, the two approaches are benchmarked using the problems from the multi-lingual PAN 2014 author identification task, as well as the more recent PAN 2021 task. Additionally, the interpretability advantages of BDI are showcased via real-world verification studies. When operating as a summary verifier, BDI tends to be more conservative in its positive attributions, particularly when applied to difÏcult problem sets like the PAN2014 en\_novels. In terms of raw performance, the BDI verifier outperforms all PAN2014 entrants and appears slightly stronger than the improved Kestemont GI according to the PAN metrics for both the 2014 and 2021 problems, while also offering superior interpretability.},

  abstract = {The application of sentiment analysis in literary studies has been limited and often criticized, yet aspectbased sentiment analysis (ABSA) offers interesting applications in this domain because it addresses some limitations of traditional SA tools and provides a more detailed and context-sensitive analysis of sentiment. To investigate its usage in literary reception studies, we apply ABSA to a corpus of ±25,000 comments written by readers in response to fanfiction about Greek mythology on fanfiction website Archive of Our Own (AO3), one of the largest platforms for fanfiction in English. Our ABSA pipeline detects sentiment (positive/negative) associated with eight aspects of fanfiction stories (general evaluation, Greek mythology, character, character emotion, reading experience, writing style, events and storyworld, and non-specific sentiment). We explain the process of data collection and annotation and present a small inter-annotator agreement study (Pairwise Cohen’s 𝜅 0.86 for aspects and 0.88 for sentiments). We develop, evaluate, and fine-tune a machine-learning pipeline for ABSA, tackling the aspect extraction and sentiment analysis tasks respectively. We obtain the best results using NuNER for aspect extraction (0.5 macro F1) and Twitter-roBERTa-sentiment for sentiment analysis (0.75 macro F1). Finally, we outline some avenues for future research and reflect on the generalizability of our method to other domains, especially to fanfiction from other fandoms and platforms but also other social media.},

However, the SFP is more complex to envision when ‘composite forms’ such as novels and dialogues are involved. In this article, and following the work of Bakhtin and Gasset, we present the idea that a composite semiotic form, such as a paragraph in a novel, does not stand for a simple referential situation only, but provides us with a context for anticipation. We show how these ideas can be expressed in the state-of-the-art language models in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and the way AI may provide us with novel directions for developing old practices of interpretation.},

  abstract = {Previous studies on classical reception related to the Vietnam War have overlooked the experiences of Vietnamese communities, whether national or diasporic, as they focussed instead on those of American combat veterans. While that scholarship has yielded important insight, it nevertheless has contributed to the disremembering of Vietnamese people that is at the core of the dominant American subjectivity of the Vietnam War, which relegates Vietnamese people to the margins of history as either enemies or victims – or worse, forgotten. To build on this scholarship, this paper closely reads three poems (‘Telemachus,’ ‘Trojan,’ and ‘Odysseus Redux’) in Ocean Vuong’s 2017 poetry collection, Night Sky With Exit Wounds, through the lenses of memory theory and queer of colour critique. I demonstrate how Vuong queers the Homeric Odyssey by subverting the canonical narrative: Odysseus returns home dead, leaving Telemachus to explore his inheritance of war as a queer refugee. Through this queer mythology, Vuong explores the conflicting layers of his intergenerational trauma, which pit refugeehood and queerness not only against each other, but also against Americanness. Overall, this paper argues that Vuong reworks the Homeric Odyssey in order to create his own ‘postmemories’ of the war that challenge historical erasure by defiantly placing the queer refugee at the centre, rather than the periphery, of an American narrative.},

Data discrimination is a real social problem. Noble argues that the combination of private interests in promoting certain sites, along with the monopoly status of a relatively small number of Internet search engines, leads to a biased set of search algorithms that privilege whiteness and discriminate against people of color, especially women of color. Through an analysis of textual and media searches as well as extensive research on paid online advertising, Noble exposes a culture of racism and sexism in the way discoverability is created online. As search engines and their related companies grow in importance--operating as a source for email, a major vehicle for primary and secondary school learning, and beyond--understanding and reversing these disquieting trends and discriminatory practices are of utmost importance."--Page 4 of cover},

The Athenians ordered arbitration to resolve the conflict, but the Samians, probably concerned that the Athenians would side with the Milesians (Diod. Sic. 12.27.1), refused, which in turn led to war between Samos and Athens. Eight months later a coup at Samos started another war. When the Samians finally surrendered, the Athenians forced them to repay the cost of the siege (               IG               I               2               .293; Thuc. 1.117.3) and collected hostages (Thuc. 1.117.3).},

  abstract = {To what extent can the phenomena of métissage and mestizaje be read as intersecting threads of a multilingual, hemispheric American story? And what do their divergences and convergences contribute to a discourse of comparison? This paper argues that métissage and mestizaje relate nonequivalent theories of wovenness in their local contexts and in relation to transnational decolonial praxes.This paper reads a resignification of mestizaje in Gloria Anzaldúa’s Borderlands/La Frontera: The New Mestiza (1987) that both embraces hybridity and reinstates a linear, teleological—and settler colonial—theory of materialities. By contrast, the narration in Gisèle Pineau’s memorial novel L’Exil selon Julia (1996) invokes métissage as a body-place wovenness through her grandmother Julia’s Antillean Creole orality, locating a kincentric ecological literacy in her relations with her beloved jardin créole. This paper then weaves these two readings together with Leslie Marmon Silko’s novel Ceremony (1977)—which, although activated neither by métissage nor mestizaje, narrates a common theory of woven matter-energy relationality in the Pueblo language and cosmology that structure Silko’s English language text. Weaving/reading hemispheric land and literature proposes a critical turning toward place-based literariness, engages multispecies kinship ontologies, and ultimately orients comparison toward kinetic theories of wovenness and with a responsibility to narrative and material story-weavings of the hemisphere.},

In the face of these issues, we call for, and point towards, a future set of methodologies that might take into account existing strengths in the humanistic close analysis of cultural objects.},

For one of the most striking features of Ovid's first run of exilic elegies is precisely the omission of the names of Ovid's addressees. As Ovid will claim in the poem that opens the Epistulae ex Ponto, it is this omission (along with a change of title) that differentiates the Tristia poems from their successors:inuenies, quamuis non est miserabilis index,non minus hoc illo triste, quod ante dedi.rebus idem, titulo differt; et epistula cui sitnon occultato nomine missa docet.(Ex Pont. 1.1.15-18)},

  abstract = {This volume is both a companion to the editors' Greek Historical Inscriptions, 404-323 BC and a successor to the later part of the Selection of Greek Historical Inscriptions to the End of the Fifth Century BC edited by Russell Meiggs and David M. Lewis and published in 1969. As with the editors' earlier volume, it seeks to make a selection of historically significant inscribed texts accessible to scholars and students of fifth-century Greek history. Since the publication of Meiggs and Lewis's collection, a number of significant new inscriptions and fragments have been unearthed and new interpretations of previously known examples developed. As well as updating the scholarly corpus, this volume aims to broaden the thematic range of inscriptions discussed and to include a greater selection of material from outside Athens, while still adhering to the intention of presenting texts that are important not just as typical of their genre but in their own right. In doing so, it offers an entry point to all aspects of fifth-century history, from political and institutional, to social, economic, and religious. In order to make the material as accessible as possible for a broad readership concerned with the study of these areas, the Greek texts are presented here alongside both English translations and incisive commentaries, which will be of utility both to the specialist academic and to those less familiar with the areas in question. The inclusion of photographs depicting inscribed stones and bronzes complements discussion of the inscriptions themselves and enables parallel consideration of their nature, appearance, and transmission history, resulting in a work of thoroughly comprehensive, cutting-edge scholarship and an invaluable reference text for the study of fifth-century Greek history.

Even focusing on a particular scientific field, the rate of new publications far outpaces even the most studious historian’s research capacity. This essay summarizes an approach to this problem that uses computational techniques of network analysis. As a complement to close analysis of particular documents, network analysis can give a large-scale perspective on the history of science, identifying relational patterns across a vast number of documents that might otherwise require an entire career to digest. To demonstrate the power of the approach, the essay applies network theory to a corpus of publications in evolutionary medicine. Four distinct networks, including those focused on authors, keywords, and citations, quickly unearth a range of relevant historical information. The essay illustrates how interpretable historical conclusions are drawn from a variety of quantitative metrics. The aim is to provide an overview of network techniques for historians looking to add robust network analysis to their research repertoire.},

The questions that the investigation addresses are: what is the significance of Nietzsche’s problematisation of science in We Philologists for our interpretation of the topic in his later works? How should we interpret these notebooks in relation to his previous writings, on the one hand, and to his later treatment of themes like the deconstruction of Christianity, the critique of eudemonism or the historical genesis of the genius on the other? Framing the notebooks as unwittingly experimental precursors of Nietzsche’s aphoristic books, the article interprets the unique nuance of the notes as an opportunity to start shedding a different light on the discussion of these questions in Nietzsche’s later works. Science, life and art become thus the focal points of a more specific and circumscribed analysis of his early thought – reconnecting these topics to their tangible origins, and tracking their early development in the context of Nietzsche’s acclaimed switch from philology to philosophy and cultural criticism.},

As a metaliterary representation of the epic and Roman history, Aeneas’s shield reproduces similar phallocentric biases as the Aeneid.

If Mauss remains unsystematic in this regard, Bourdieu delivers a theory of capitals illustrating the power of non-human beings, a view promoted by Bruno Latour in his sociology of associations. Chapter 5 compares Bourdieu and Latour, and shows that they have similar views on the link between mediations and institutions, the role of the institutions in the consecration of the cycles of the relation, the legitimacy of the actors and of the institutions involved in this cycles. Both view this legitimacy as dependant on shared interests between actors and institutions, an argument which puts Latour not only near to Bourdieu, but also to Émile Durkheim.},

It suggests that the selection of Sicily is driven in part by the interpretative possibilities raised by this location, in particular, those fuelled by controversies regarding the rational and mythic which were attached to the island. It focusses on the rationalizing and mythic approaches associated with Sicily in the classical and post-classical tradition in the areas of volcanic activity and the discovery of gigantic bones. By means of a close reading of the episode in which King Meleander entertains Radirobanes in camp, followed by a wider discussion of the flaws of Meleander and Radirobanes and the theme of interpretation in the novel, it explores how Barclay exploits such approaches to showcase the failures of these leaders. It also dismisses the idea that the Argenis has a controlling divine framework which would run counter to the novel’s interest in the potentiality of interpretation.},

As his decision brings him face-to-face with a nation at war with itself, the loved ones Hero left behind debate whether to escape or wait for his return, only to discover that for Hero, free will may have come at a great spiritual cost.A devastatingly beautiful dramatic work filled with music, wit and great lyricism, Father Comes Home From the Wars is an epic tale about holding on to who we are and what we love in a country that both brings us together and rips us apart. Father Comes Home From the Wars (Parts 1, 2 \& 3) enjoyed its world premiere production in October-December 2014, Off-Broadway at The Public Theater. It received rave reviews and was extended twice. The world premiere production will be seen at American Repertory Theater in Cambridge, Massachusetts, beginning January 2015.Praise for Father Comes Home From the Wars: "By turns philosophical and playful, lyrical and earthy, Suzan-Lori Parks's new play, Father Comes Home From the Wars (Parts 1, 2 \& 3), swoops, leaps, dives and soars across three endlessly stimulating hours, reimagining a turbulent turning point in American history through a cockeyed contemporary lens... The finest work yet from this gifted writer... [It] just be the best new play I've seen all year... The wonder of Ms. Parks's achievement is how smoothly she blends the high and the low, the serious and the humorous, the melodramatic and the grittily realistic; [she has] a voice that can transform blunt, vernacular language into fluid, flowing free verse." - Charles Isherwood, New York Times"A nine-part serial whose first three parts are now being produced... Can one-third of something already be a masterpiece? Seems like it to me.... People long for stories that engage the deepest possible issues in the most gripping possible ways. Father Comes Home From the Wars is one of those stories -- or maybe more than one." - Jesse Green, New York Magazine "Brilliant, beautiful... With this vibrant freestanding trilogy... Parks has achieved something that engages with a bold theatricality both lyrical and raw, without sacrificing any of her thematic ambition or her structural and intellectual complexity. Each of the three parts thrums with its own vitality [and they] form a mutually invigorating whole. Parks' incomparable command of percussive vernacular is no surprise, and her dialogue here might just as easily be sung. This haunting work is funny and tragic, whimsical and lacerating, poetic and poignant, navigating its radical tonal shifts with fluidity and grace.... If Parks can sustain her sprawling project at this level as it moves forward, there's every reason to hope it will ultimately become no less significant and emotionally resonant an undertaking than August Wilson's ten-play Century Cycle." - David Rooney, Hollywood Reporter "The best new play of the year... It is bold, hugely entertaining, moving and thrillingly ambitious. Playwright Suzan-Lori Parks bids fair to create a sprawling multi-part epic to plant alongside August Wilson's monumental Century Cycle, one of the great achievements in theater history. Parts 4 through 9 (? or more?) can't come fast enough for me." - Michael Giltz, Huffington Post "--},

  abstract = {Abstract: This paper examines parchment's transition from a dominant writing material to a perceived marker of antiquity in Western manuscript studies, exploring the consequences of this shift for the later production and preservation of parchment books. Focusing on the development of Icelandic manuscript culture during the seventeenth century, the role of antiquarianism and heightened interest in the writings of the past is considered. The rise of Nordic antiquarianism brought Icelandic scribes and patrons into contact with a scholarly culture driven by a desire for textual authenticity and a broad rediscovery of the history of ancient Scandinavia. Old Norse-Icelandic parchment codices were coveted by academics and collectors alike. At the same time, the seventeenth century saw the emergence of a new phenomenon: high-status parchment books that emulate the mediality of medieval book objects. Icelandic scribes had only recently transitioned to paper for manuscript production, and this paper argues that these younger manuscripts were not created as forgeries, even if there is some evidence for deliberate alteration post-production to make them appear older. Instead, calfskin's newfound status as a writing surface of and for the past encouraged creative engagement with vellum. Analysis reveals that many of the surviving vellum volumes are associated with elite circles in North and West Iceland, and the well-connected book production hub of Hólar in particular. A nostalgic revival of vellum may have occurred within learned circles in Iceland, parallel to the export of manuscripts to the mainland. Using the example of GKS 1002–1003, a pair of manuscripts commissioned by a wealthy farmer in South Iceland whose family had close kinship ties to the bishops of Hólar and Skálholt, it is argued that new vellum manuscripts had a legitimizing function for their owners, allowing those who commissioned them to claim membership in Iceland's literary and cultural elite.},

I draw on a comparative analysis of the fields of Islam in France and India, informed by the work of Bourdieu and Fanon. I first argue that Bourdieu’s concept of the religious field provides a crucial reframing of the Islamic field whereby religious judgments represent classification struggles over legitimate Islam. Second, I approach misrecognition in the field by distinguishing the field’s discourse from its doxa. I argue that misrecognition varies according to the degree of (1) subaltern minority integration into educational institutions and (2) proximity of the subaltern to the dominant classes. I bring in the work of Fanon, whose writings on the psychological effects of racial domination are a crucial complement to a Bourdieusian analysis. Together, they provide a more refined understanding of misrecognition in racialized religious fields and, in turn, potential for political resistance.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Positive Humanities can be defined as the branch of learning concerned with culture in its relation to human flourishing. This new field advocates for a eudaimonic turn in the humanities, an explicit recognition of and commitment to human flourishing as a central theme of study and practical aim of the humanities. It holds that this eudaimonic turn can reconnect the humanities with their initial values and goals and provide a unifying and inspiring rationale for the humanities today, opening pathways for greater individual and collective flourishing in societies around the world. After exploring the historical roots and conceptual orientations of the Positive Humanities (which are inclusive of the arts), I present five recommendations for strengthening the focus of the humanities on human flourishing: emphasize 1) wisdom as much as knowledge, 2) collaboration as much as specialization, 3) the positive as much as the negative, 4) effective friction as much as increased efficiency, and 5) the flourishing of humans as much as the flourishing of the humanities.},

  abstract = {Over the past decade, digital humanities scholarship has developed dramatically in Anglosphere universities. However, elsewhere such as China Mainland, little interest is yet visible in this scholarship. Still controversial over its methodology and epistemology, and too early to predict its future, digital humanities scholars have made respectful and encouraging commitments and accomplishments. The self-protection of humanities from further marginalization, through intersection with and integration of techno-humanities, is in line with the well-established value of innovation and the ubiquitous needs of social improvement. From both a macro and micro perspective, the author of this article contends that digital humanities scholarship can contribute to the humanities as a whole, by expanding comparative literature studies with data-based empiricism. However, as a new approach to comparative literature, digital humanities is still in its fledgling stage and faces a slew of challenges: inadequate involvement from humanities scholars, undefined boundaries within humanities disciplines, lack of global recognition, and immature theoretical models to propel future research.},

We analyze and make explicit the model properties needed for such regularities to emerge in word vectors. The result is a new global logbilinear regression model that combines the advantages of the two major model families in the literature: global matrix factorization and local context window methods. Our model efficiently leverages statistical information by training only on the nonzero elements in a word-word cooccurrence matrix, rather than on the entire sparse matrix or on individual context windows in a large corpus. The model produces a vector space with meaningful substructure, as evidenced by its performance of 75\% on a recent word analogy task. It also outperforms related models on similarity tasks and named entity recognition.},

The Erinyes wake up and continue the persecution of Orestes, as Apollo cannot keep them permanently asleep.

Aeschylus’ idea of putting the perpetual cycle of retributive violence to “sleep” is not inadequate. The Erinyes are placed in a subterranean site under the court of the Areopagus, and thus the “sleep” of their μένος becomes an allegory that secures political harmony for the city.},

Learning more about these distributions can help us better understand how different genres, cultures and time periods simulate personhood, i.e. what it means to be an agent in the world. Prior research has emphasized fiction’s capacity to promote ”social cognition” (Theory of Mind) on the part of readers, where the complex cognitive states of literary characters are thought to facilitate deeper reasoning about human motivations and behavior. The data and models used here add an important dimension to this theory by highlighting how the actions that have increasingly distinguished fictional characters from their nonfictional counterparts over time entail forms of embodiment rather than explicit invocations of cognitive or emotional behavior. These results suggest that embodiment has emerged as a central value in the fictional representation of personhood.},

  abstract = {Griselda Gambaro’s Antígona furiosa captures the complexities and paradoxes of post-dictatorship Argentina through its interwoven engagements with Sophoclean, Shakespearean and Latin American subtexts. In grappling with these complexities, the play deploys a repetitive structure that critics have over-simplified as a mere reference to the repeated protests of the Madres de Plaza de Mayo. I suggest instead that we should understand these repetitions as forms of anastrophe, a word used by the first Guard in Sophocles’ Antigone to mean ‘going back’, but that can also mean ‘overthrow’, ‘confusion’, ‘habitat’, and in a military context, both ‘rally’ and ‘retreat’. Applied to Gambaro’s play, anastrophe describes the interwoven, mutually reinforcing and self-referencing threads of influence coming from the play’s literary, cultural and historical contexts that, despite their roots in the past, press forward into the future. Moreover, Gambaro and Antígona’s version of repetition makes clear the Madres’ demands for justice not as reparation but as a complete rejection of the society that made the dictatorship’s crimes possible. In this way, I develop a method of reading through Gambaro’s dense web of references to Sophocles, Shakespeare and Darío that increases our understanding of the political stakes of Antígona’s protest, as Gambaro says, ‘in her time and in ours’.},

  abstract = {The Colegio de Santa Cruz de Tlatelolco, established in 1536, liberally educated the sons of Nahua (Aztec) leaders in New Spain. Its Franciscan pedagogues, including Bernardino de Sahagu´n (c. 1499–1590), Andre´s de Olmos (1491–1571) and Juan Bautista (c. 1555–1606/13), worked with indigenous students and alumni to collect, edit and circulate Nahuatl huehuetlahtolli, or ‘speech of the ancients’. This paper examines the largest collection of these orations printed in premodern Mexico, the Huehuetlahtolli [1601] edited by Juan Bautista and indigenous intellectuals from the college. It argues that the Tlatelolcans adapted Nahuatl ‘old words’ for the New World of colonial society. They ornamented the speeches with rhetorical techniques derived from Santa Cruz’s Erasmian curriculum. They interpolated biblical sentences, particularly from Proverbs and Sirach, to enhance the evangelising potential of the discourses. Finally, they drew on Erasmus’s theory of speech, as expressed in his pedagogical and spiritual writings, to explicate Nahuatl los difrasismos concerning eloquence and good counsel. Contextualising the Huehuetlahtolli [1601] in Santa Cruz’s Erasmian schoolroom reveals the contours of its argument for vernacular evangelisation, the liberal education of indigenous youth and for the elegance of the Nahuatl tongue.},

  abstract = {The Gersum Project has significantly developed our understanding of Norse-derived terms in English by providing a highly systematic typology for their identification. However, this article shows that, in order to fully comprehend the lexical impact that Anglo-Scandinavian contact had on medieval English, we need to go beyond the identification of the Norsederived terms and explore their process of integration into English. To exemplify the benefits of this approach, the article analyses the make-up of the lexico-semantic field of EMOTION, particularly FEAR, in the texts attributed to the Gawain-poet, and examines the interaction between native, Norse- and French-derived terms. This analysis moves away from the traditional study of the texts’ vocabulary in relation to their sociohistorical context, considering the terms instead from semasiological, onomasiological and stylistic perspectives. By taking this novel approach, this article addresses key linguistic and literary topics: the formal and semantic factors that facilitated the integration of Norsederived terms into this lexico-semantic field and, more broadly, the impact that multilingualism had on the expression of emotions in medieval England; diachronic and diatopic variation in the field; and the Gawain-poet’s artistry and interest in fear as a key emotion closely linked to other affective and cognitive processes.},

  abstract = {Character n-gram F-score (CHRF) is shown to correlate very well with human relative rankings of different machine translation outputs, especially for morphologically rich target languages. However, its relation with direct human assessments is not yet clear. In this work, Pearson’s correlation coefficients for direct assessments are investigated for two currently available target languages, English and Russian. First, different β parameters (in range from 1 to 3) are re-investigated with direct assessment, and it is confirmed that β = 2 is the optimal option. Then separate character and word n-grams are investigated, and the main finding is that, apart from character n-grams, word 1-grams and 2-grams also correlate rather well with direct assessments. Further experiments show that adding word unigrams and bigrams to the standard CHRF score improves the correlations with direct assessments, though it is still not clear which option is better, unigrams only (CHRF+) or unigrams and bigrams (CHRF++). This should be investigated in future work on more target languages.},

  abstract = {The early Greek literary texts date back to the eighth century bce. In the age of literary oral tradition (eighth–fifth century bce), the language of literary texts does not coincide with any vernacular dialects, but every literary genre is characterized by a conventional language, in which elements of a specific dialect or of various dialects are present. The origin, evolution, and history of the different literary genres determine the characteristics of the so-called literary languages, which are used by poets and writers according to the literary genre of their compositions, regardless of the place of birth or the geographical context of the authors. So archaic epic diction contains Ionic and Aeolic elements; the language of the Theban Pindar has a Doric color, like all choral melic poems; and early scientific prose adopts many elements of the Ionian dialect, but it is different from spoken Ionian language. With the age of Koiné (“common language,” used from the end of the fourth century bce in the Macedonian Empire) and with the achievement of the book as a medium for literary communication, every poet and writer uses his own style and language: this language draws on tradition, but often cum variatione. Therefore, from the Hellenistic age onward, it is impossible to talk of literary languages in general, but one must investigate the language and style of each individual author.},

  abstract = {"This is a book about Homer-who probably never existed but nonetheless survives as one of the most important authors in Western literature. Homer, like Shakespeare, has never ceased to be an object of fascination. Surely the greatest attraction to Homer lies not in his greatness as an author but in his utter mystery. Was there really a man, an author named Homer? In this corner are those who think that there was and that there existed Ur texts of The Iliad and The Odyssey. On the other side are those who view the blind Homer as an icon, a legend created and circulated in later centuries when values of authorship were finally codified. As one of the foremost Homerists, James Porter is uniquely qualified to write about these issues. It is important to stress that his book is not a reception study of the poetry of Homer. Rather, it is written for a broad array of general readers, scholars, and cultural pundits, and it explores the cultural value and, in a narrower sense, the history of a particular value in our culture (represented by "Homer"). Porter sees this value as a particular fascination and an uncertain cipher around which questions of meaning and identity come to be constructed. Porter suspects that with Homer the ancients and moderns have made a rather telling choice of object for contention, one that ceaselessly authorizes the imaginative work of culture"--},

  abstract = {Figurative language (FL) seems ubiquitous in all social media discussion forums and chats, posing extra challenges to sentiment analysis endeavors. Identification of FL schemas in short texts remains largely an unresolved issue in the broader field of natural language processing, mainly due to their contradictory and metaphorical meaning content. The main FL expression forms are sarcasm, irony and metaphor. In the present paper, we employ advanced deep learning methodologies to tackle the problem of identifying the aforementioned FL forms. Significantly extending our previous work (Potamias et al., in: International conference on engineering applications of neural networks, Springer, Berlin, pp 164–175, 2019), we propose a neural network methodology that builds on a recently proposed pre-trained transformer-based network architecture which is further enhanced with the employment and devise of a recurrent convolutional neural network. With this setup, data preprocessing is kept in minimum. The performance of the devised hybrid neural architecture is tested on four benchmark datasets, and contrasted with other relevant state-of-the-art methodologies and systems. Results demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves state-of-the-art performance under all benchmark datasets, outperforming, even by a large margin, all other methodologies and published studies.},

  abstract = {Near the end of his career, Dante wrote two eclogues, instigating a literary fashion which was to outlast the Renaissance. These poems—Dante’s only known compositions in Latin verse—were prompted by a verse epistle from Giovanni ‘del Virgilio’, in which the humanist scholar goaded Dante to compose a martial epic in Latin celebrating contemporary Italian military victories, which would prove him a worthy successor to the author of the Aeneid. Dante’s response is an elaborate bucolic recusatio, which engages in a rich and intricate intertextual dialogue both with Virgil and with his correspondent. Through a pattern of allusions emphasizing the theme of land-confiscation and dispossession in Virgil’s Bucolica and his denunciation of the avarice and violence of contemporary Rome in the Georgics, Dante makes the case that his own career has fulfilled the noble aspirations which Virgil himself compromised, when he abandoned the idea of a cosmological epic, entertained in the second Georgic and chose instead to glorify war and the emperor in the Aeneid.},

Two references, then, to the liveliness of objects, but each meaning very different things. For the scholiast places man on the same side as materiality, as if humans and things can equally be infused with life and can exist in a sort of continuum, but Weil argues that a human who is reduced to mere matter, even if he is a still a thing that breathes, is as good as nothing. Unlike the scholiast, Weil's interpretation is predicated on a strong belief in the duality of body and soul in the structure of human life, and since objects do not have souls they are, for her, essentially dead. Throughout her essay, Weil visits again and again the materiality of Homeric man and his propensity to turn, under the crushing power of force, into what she calls alternately a ‘thing’, ‘inert matter’, ‘stone’, and even ‘nothingness’. But for the D scholiast, the comparison of Ajax to stone does not subjugate him or turn him into a ‘mere’ or ‘inert’ object. On the contrary, the gloss ἔμψυχον τεῖχος speaks instead to the lively and permeable boundary between human and nonhuman in early Greek epic, one that suggests that objects can have their own life form, their own energy, vitality, and even creativity.},

  abstract = {Abstract: This study presents the results of the first scientific tests carried out on the inks of the 'Bologna Scroll' (Biblioteca Universitaria di Bologna, Rotolo 2). Written c. 1200 in Spain or Provence, the Bologna Scroll is the oldest known surviving complete Torah scroll. Some Jewish sources require that Torah scrolls, which serve a liturgical function, be written using carbon ink to be considered valid for ritual use. The goals of this study were to determine whether multiple inks were used in the production and correction of the scroll and to identify the ink type (carbon, mixed, or iron-gall) of each of these inks. Near-infrared reflectography suggested that all inks tested—in both the original text and corrections—were iron-gall inks. A limited array of tests using X-ray fluorescence demonstrated that the main text of the scroll was originally written using at least two inks, although there is no obvious paleographical indication that more than one scribe wrote the main text. Hence, the original scribe may have switched inks at some point during the original production of the scroll.},

The effectiveness of transfer learning has given rise to a diversity of approaches, methodology, and practice. In this paper, we explore the landscape of transfer learning techniques for NLP by introducing a unified framework that converts all text-based language problems into a text-to-text format. Our systematic study compares pre-training objectives, architectures, unlabeled data sets, transfer approaches, and other factors on dozens of language understanding tasks. By combining the insights from our exploration with scale and our new ``Colossal Clean Crawled Corpus'', we achieve state-of-the-art results on many benchmarks covering summarization, question answering, text classification, and more. To facilitate future work on transfer learning for NLP, we release our data set, pre-trained models, and code.},

Due to its great transcendence in traditional Peruvian music, its antiquity, richness of variations, and particular sound, Peru’s National Institute of Culture (INC) declared the quena to be National Cultural Heritage. The Amazonian quena is an instrument that originates from the Andean quena and studies about it are very scarce. The aim of this study was to analyze the perceptions of music teachers about the Amazonian quena in educational institutions in the province of Datem del Marañón, Loreto. Qualitative research methods were used in this study to address the research question. A qualitative case study was the approach selected to undertake the study. The method to gather information from key informants consisted of a semi-structured interview with two quena teachers from an educational institution, with personal experiences, attitudes, perceptions and beliefs related to the Amazonian quena. The participants received an information sheet with details regarding the voluntary nature of their participation, confidentiality and anonymity, and the nature and aims of the research. This study used the method of thematic analysis to identify themes, categories, concepts and meaning. Results indicate that the Amazonian quena is an important instrument widely played during ceremonies and on festive occasions, where they preserve a role and are a symbol of popular culture and a strong sense of regional identity.},

The masses subjected to the society of spectacle have traditionally been seen as aesthetically and politically passive - in response, both artists and thinkers have sought to transform the spectator into an active agent and the spectacle into a performance. In this follow-up to the acclaimed "The Future of the Image", Ranciere takes a radically different approach to this attempted emancipation. Beginning by asking exactly what we mean by political art or the politics of art, he goes on to look at what the tradition of critical art, and the desire to insert art into life, has achieved. Has the militant critique of the consumption of images and commodities become, instead, a melancholic affirmation of their omnipotence?},

We also examine the models’ abilities to translate sonnets while preserving the rhyme scheme of the source text. Our findings suggest that LLMs can serve as valuable tools for literary translators, assisting with the creative process and suggesting solutions to problems that may not otherwise have been considered. However, if the paradigm is flipped, such that instead of the systems being as tools by human translators, humans are used to post-edit the outputs to a standard comparable to the published translations, the amount of work required to complete the post-editing stage may outweigh any benefits associated with using machine translation in the first place.},

Pushing against the traditional narrative of German realism's apolitical provinciality, it argues that media technologies from the British picturesque tradition, transmitted by way of Irving, aided Stifter in obscuring his cosmopolitan and colonialist ideologies. Picturesque observational practices, which emphasized the imaginative and artistic “improvement” of reality, overlap considerably with German realist techniques of transfiguration, and Irving's and Stifter's texts both emphasize the epiphanic experience of life and art, of reality and its mediation. Linking the epistemological dimensions of both periods to early statistical thought and illustrating how the authors’ preferred genres of the sketch and study pull from the same artistic and media-historical discourse, the essay uncovers striking continuities between the Germanophone and American literary contexts, recasting German realism as fully enmeshed within the global context it seemingly disavows.},

In this study, students were either in a control secondary science classroom or a classroom in which instruction was tiered. The tiered instruction was designed to matched to high, middle, or low levels of background knowledge on astronomy and Newtonian physics. The seven control classrooms received middle-level nontiered instruction, whereas the seven treatment classrooms delivered three levels of tiered instruction. The results of this study showed a significant difference between the scores of low background knowledge learners who received tiered instruction and low background learners who did not receive tiered instruction, indicating that tiered instruction may be especially beneficial for lower level learners. Through the implementation of this study, the researchers found that: (1) professional support for teachers is critical to the success of tiered instruction; (2) a strong background in the subject matter and a thorough understanding of the range of potential learning activities appropriate to the targeted levels of learners is essential; and (3) the implementation of a change of instructional and classroom organization, pedagogy, and expectations needs to be systematically introduced over time.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in NLP have led to the creation of powerful language models for many languages including Ancient Greek and Latin. While prior work on Classical languages unanimously uses BERT, in this work we create four language models for Ancient Greek that vary along two dimensions to study their versatility for tasks of interest for Classical languages: we explore (i) encoder-only and encoder-decoder architectures using ROBERTA and T5 as strong model types, and create for each of them (ii) a monolingual Ancient Greek and a multilingual instance that includes Latin and English. We evaluate all models on morphological and syntactic tasks, including lemmatization, which demonstrates the added value of T5’s decoding abilities. We further define two probing tasks to investigate the knowledge acquired by models pre-trained on Classical texts. Our experiments provide the first benchmarking analysis of existing models of Ancient Greek. Results show that our models provide significant improvements over the SoTA. The systematic analysis of model types can inform future research in designing language models for Classical languages, including the development of novel generative tasks. We make all our models available as community resources, along with a large curated pre-training corpus for Ancient Greek, to support the creation of a larger, comparable model zoo for Classical Philology.

  abstract = {Abstract             This article describes an approach to the treatment of texts in complex large textual traditions. Editors are interested in the text as it appears line-by-line in each document, and in how the versions of the text differ from document to document. It is useful to define a text as the record of an act of communication, inscribed in a document: thus, the instance of the act of communication we identify as Geoffrey Chaucer’s Canterbury Tales, as it appears in the Hengwrt manuscript. In this view, every text has a dual aspect: it is both the words as they are inscribed in a particular document, and as they constitute an act of communication and its parts. This presents challenges for scholars who wish to record both aspects. In encoding implementations, these two aspects are commonly treated as ‘overlapping hierarchies’. However, the ‘overlapping hierarchy’ model does not deal with cases where text segments are not contiguous in either aspect and cannot overlap cleanly. To meet these cases, the Textual Communities project developed an architecture in which the two aspects are represented as distinct and independent hierarchies (trees), with text segments referenced to nodes on each tree. The linking of text segments to the two trees is managed by a JSON database, accessed through transcription and collation tools presented in a Web interface. Textual Communities does not implement the whole of this architecture in terms of validation, ingestion, and processing. Full exploration and implementation of the architecture here described are challenges for future scholars.},

  abstract = {This article discusses how Bertolt Brecht employed the ancient figure of Niobe as a model for several of his female characters. The examples examined here are his adaptation of Antigone, where the protagonist compares herself to Niobe, as in the classic Sophocles drama; the allusions by Polly Peachum in the Pirate Jenny song in the stage version of The Threepenny Opera; and the dialectical interaction between Mother Courage and her mute daughter Kattrin in Mother Courage and Her Children. Each such “likeness” encompasses a strong emotional involvement or empathy with the Trauer, or sorrow, of the ancient figure of Niobe, who was petrified for boasting of her many children to Leto, and whose offspring then killed all of her children. At the same time, Brecht also allows his characters to resist and even protest against their ancient female role model. On the basis of these examples, the article discusses Brecht’s modern version of the Trauerspiel, based on Walter Benjamin’s ideas; his development of the notion of the model and the model-book with Niobe as a model for the modelling process itself; and, finally, the importance of the notion of the Halt, a stop or interruption, for this modelling process. The article suggests that the close interdependence between Brecht’s oeuvre and the ideas of his close friend Walter Benjamin concerning the Trauerspiel reveals the modelling aspect of many of Brecht’s female characters as well as his multifaceted, critical approach to tragedy.},

I show that Anchises’ so-called “seduction” by Aphrodite ought to be read as sexualized violence committed by deception. I then demonstrate that Aphrodite is able to enact her exploitation of Anchises by enticing him into completing what he thinks will be a “heroic rape,” a common trope of classical myth in which a god or hero acts as rapist. By applying some insights about the rape-revenge film genre, I show how archaic Greek notions of sex, gender, and power are, and are not, challenged by the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite.},

The second section discusses how Thucydides explicitly elaborates in his Archaeology a theory of human development according to which practices that were once common to all peoples now survive in certain parts of the Greek world as well as among non-Greeks, and how he sees the Peloponnesian War as marking the breakdown of the spatial and temporal divisions set up in the Archaeology. The final section shows how many aspects of this sort of (explicit and implicit) spatial-temporal patterning can be found in Herodotus’ work. It suggests some reasons why (unlike Thucydides) Herodotus does not unite these aspects in a concentrated vision of spatio-temporal developments.},

From the perspective of metaphrasis, the central question one asks of a form is not what it is. Metaphrasis encourages us to ask, instead: What is the range of this poem's formal possibilities? What variety of forms might this poem take? What variety of forms should this poem take? Or what variety of forms would this poem take under a specific set of alternative conditions, whether we conceive of those conditions along historical, aesthetic, or ethical axes? In this essay, I take up a single stanza from Edmund Spenser's               The Faerie Queene               (1596), and I argue that where form establishes the parameters of possibility for a poem, the critical activity of metaphrasis permits us to imagine the world of the poem otherwise.},

To address this gap, this article presents a comprehensive methodology for applying co-citation analysis to extensive collections of historical documents, specifically 17th-century letters indexed in the ePistolarium database. In science mapping, co-citation serves as an indicator for tracking the development of scientific fields. Similarly, I employ co-citation to map the Dutch socio-intellectual landscape during the Scientific Revolution period (1623–87) and evaluate the strengths and limitations of this approach.},

In this article, we analyze the anthropological and metaphysical components of the representation of death in video games following the German philosopher Hans Blumenberg’s theory of the absolutism of reality, as well as the case of Blasphemous and its promotional storytelling to determine how death appears as a sales concept in the publicity due to its place in the players’ common symbolic consciousness.},

In particular, it traces the reception history of the ninth of Ovid's Heroides, in which Deianira writes a letter of complaint, about her husband's sexual violence, and her disastrous attempt to reclaim his affections. Responses to Ovid's poem ranged from outrage – male poets angrily refuted Deianira's accusations – to vernacular translations that, in the hands of the Tudor writer George Turberville, sympathetically conveyed the anguish of the abused wife, but in the hands of Turberville's seventeenth-century successors, muted or silenced Deianira's complaints. The essay locates this reception history in the context of debates about domesticity, sexual (mis)conduct, and female literacy.},

This singular problem, which Ruda argues is the problem of Hegelian political thought, appears in Hegel's text only in a seemingly marginal form under the name of the "rabble": a particular side-effect of the dialectical deduction of the necessity of the existence of state from the contradictory constitution of civil society. Working out from a thorough analysis of this problem and drawing on contemporary discussions in the work of such thinkers as Alain Badiou, Jean-Luc Nancy and Slavoj Zizek, the book proceeds to re-examine and reconstruct Hegel's entire political project. Ruda goes on to argue that only by re-thinking this problem of 'the rabble' in Hegel's thought - the only problem Hegel is able neither to resolve nor to sublate - can the early Marxian conception of 'the proletariat' be properly understood. The book closes with an Afterword from Slavoj Zizek.},

These museums pioneered new kinds of relationships with their communities that were far different from older museums and, in the process, helped fundamentally enlarge and diversify public humanities. The essay begins with a focus on three museums founded in 1967: El Museo del Barrio in New York City, the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum (Smithsonian) in Washington, D.C., and the Wing Luke Museum in Seattle. Over the last fifty years, these museums have grown and stabilized and newer, bigger museums with similar goals have developed. These changes suggest that one future for humanities scholars is to become involved in new publics outside of the academy who are seeking humanistic analysis of their distinctive, previously marginalized, community stories.},

The recent removal of monuments has drawn renewed attention to the problem of singular public histories. I argue for a polyvocal, repertory model of public history as theorized through the collectively written 2016 play               The Fall               , which records the events of the 2015–16 student protests in South Africa. The essay begins by contextualizing the play in the longer history of workshop theater and educational inequality in South Africa before specifically examining its approach to public history. Such performance-sensitive historiography enacts anticolonial epistemologies by replacing the singular representation of monumentalism with copresence amid contested histories.},

A shift towards visual access to the text occurred in the Middle Ages, allowing private understanding unmediated by aural cues. The author discusses the role of non-Latin speakers in this change, and observes that by the beginning of the fteenth century the manuscripts took their most modern form, that of a text designed for private, silent reading.},

This is a consequence of the modern debate on ancient Egyptian racial identity. Inevitably, commentators on 2.104 have been heavily concerned with defending their predispositions about ancient Egyptian racial identity. As a result, there has been no critical engagement with Herodotus' conceptualization of Blackness. This analysis uses critical race theory to address this methodological problem. Contrary to the consensus in Greco-Roman studies, Blackness was a factor in ancient Greek racial thought. It is evident that Herodotus' own understanding of Blackness did not differ from the general Greek worldview. Ultimately, this analysis shows that Blackness was a significant aspect of Herodotus' ethnography for particular racial groups.},

In the initial approach we follow a state-of-the-art strategy, which consists on standardizing the spelling and the lexicon. This approach boosts POS-tagging accuracy to 90, which represents a raw improvement of over 20\% with respect to the results obtained without any pre-processing. In order to enable non-expert users in NLP to use this new resource, the corpus has been integrated into IAC (Corpora Interface Access). We discuss the shortcomings of the initial approach and propose a new one, which does not consist in adapting the source texts to the tagger, but rather in modifying the tagger for the direct treatment of the old variants.This second strategy addresses some important shortcomings in the previous approach and is likely to be useful not only in the creation of diachronic linguistic resources but also for the treatment of dialectal or non-standard variants of synchronic languages as well.},

Building four historical exhibitions in the Boyle Heights community, this team is a reflection of the growing awareness of the need to establish new institutional practices in archiving and historical presentations that reach new immigrant communities. New PhD students are in search of approaches to historical training, publishing, and output that engage with these new publics.

This article offers a new model of sedes expectancy that identifies unexpected metrical positions of words and demonstrates its utility in an intervention in intertextual studies and close reading of a passage (Odyssey 1.345–59). In both, the model reveals otherwise invisible patterns of style, structure, semantics, and rhetoric that suggest a poetics of sedes expectancy persists within and between Greek hexameter texts.},

Assuming that men and women speak or write differently, can a great author take account of this difference? Previous studies have ascertained some stylistic markers that can discriminate between men and women either in writing or oral productions. The main aim of this study is to verify whether in Shakespeare’s plays female figures are talking in a distinct way compared with male ones. First, this study confirms the effectiveness of a set of predefined stylistic features using a tweet dataset extracted from CLEF-PAN corpora. Second, we demonstrate that the two genders present distinct styles when analyzing twenty-nine of Shakespeare’s plays, demonstrating that the author adopts a distinct style for each gender. Our experiments are grounded on two efficient classifiers (logistic regression and random forest) able to automatically identify short passages (500 or 1,000 word-tokens) corresponding to either a male or a female utterance with an accuracy of around 80\%.},

  abstract = {The automatic assignment of a text to one or more predefined categories presents multiple applications. In this context, the current study focuses on author attribution in which the true author of a doubtful text must be identified. This analysis focuses on the style of sixty-six French comedies in verse written by seventeen supposed authors during the 17th century. The hypothe­ sis we want to verify assumes that the real author is the name appearing on the cover (called the signature hypothesis). In order to validate the reliability of two attribution procedures, we used two additional corpora based on 200 extracts of novels written in French, with thirty authors and 140 Italian novels authored by forty persons. After this verification, we propose an improvement of the Delta method as well as a new analysis grid for this model. Finally, we applied these approaches to our French comedy corpus. The results demonstrate that the signature hypothesis must be discarded. Moreover, these works present similar styles, making any attribution difficult to support with a high degree of certainty.},

I argue that in the actions and speeches of the play there is a questioning of the exclusion of women and bastards from political deliberation. A study of the language of the play reveals that Tecmessa, Ajax’s concubine, and Teucer, his bastard half-brother, exercise logos while the Homeric hero Ajax consistently resorts to the sort of sounds used by animals that give voice (phonê) to pain. The dismissal of the speech of women and those from the lower ranks of society proves detrimental to the lives of those who choose to silence them.},

Outline of a Theory of Practice (1977) and Discipline and Punish (1979) are two of the most influential contributions in post-structural and postmodern theory. Yet, far more attention is paid to Foucault’s contributions in criminology than to Bourdieu’s. This essay brings together the work of these influential theorists to argue for a critical examination of the sociology of prisons. Bourdieu’s concepts of: (1) habitus, (2) ethos, (3) doxa, and (4) the theory of practice are related to Foucault’s ideas about (1) discipline, (2) docile bodies, (3) panopticism, and (4) history of the present by comparing specific examples from the original works. Then, the combination of those primary concepts is used to address specific methodological concerns researchers should consider when doing empirical research in prison.},

These two problems can be reduced to one by observing that every case of overlapping hierarchies is also a case of textual variation. Overlapping textual structures can be accurately modelled either as a minimally redundant directed graph, or, more practically, as an ordered list of pairs, each containing a set of versions and a fragment of text or data. This ‘pairs-list’ representation is provably equivalent to the graph representation. It can record texts consisting of thousands of versions or perspectives without becoming overloaded with data, and the most common operations on variant text, e.g. comparison between two versions, can be performed in linear time. This representation also separates variation or other overlapping structures from the document content, leading to a simplification of markup suitable for wiki-like web applications.},

Adopting a different approach, I argue that anecdotes about plundered libraries were a means by which imperial authors contested the extent and nature of foreign cultural influence on Rome and hence the makeup of Romanness itself.},

Embracing methodologies from across the humanities and social sciences, we understand physical materials as actants, with particular frequencies, energies, and potentials to affect human and nonhuman worlds. The texts, stage properties, instruments, costumes, photographs, and detritus that animate this collection emerge from the thirteenth- to the twenty-first century, traversing sites across Europe and North America. Challenging anthropocentric narratives that foreground humans as sole agents, our authors present object and 'thingcentric' methodologies that range from deeply personal autoethnographic reflections and close textual readings to carefully researched archival studies and rhizomatic explorations of an object's journey from one place and time to another"--},

  abstract = {How were the Greeks of the sixth century BC able to invent philosophy and tragedy? In this book Richard Seaford argues that a large part of the answer can be found in another momentous development, the invention and rapid spread of coinage which produced the first ever thoroughly monetised society. By transforming social relations, monetisation contributed to the ideas of the universe as an impersonal system (presocratic philosophy) and of the individual alienated from his own kin and from the gods (in tragedy). Seaford argues that an important precondition for this monetisation was the Greek practice of animal sacrifice, as represented in Homeric Epic, which describes a premonetary world on the point of producing money. This book combines social history, economic anthropology, numismatics and the close reading of literary, inscriptional, and philosophical texts. Questioning the origins and shaping force of Greek philosophy, this is a major book with wide appeal.},

It was an important book because it argued that "sexuality" and "desire" were not a historical phenomenon but carefully managed social constructs. This insight (that actually originated with Michael Foucault) is often viewed as anti-humanist or post-humanist because it argues that men and women are simply the products of patriarchal power relations over which they have no control. By mobilizing Foucault's theories of the history of sexuality Sedgwick re-fashions Feminism and Gay and Lesbian Studies to make it seem as though Feminism and Gay and Lesbian studies are ideally situated to continue those interventions into the history of sexuality begun by Foucault},

The interpretation of Birds 1360–69 has divided commentators since antiquity: does the youth receive wings to be viewed as weapons or weapons to be viewed as wings? On the basis of internal textual evidence and intertextual allusions, I argue for the latter option: instead of the requested bird apparatus, Peisthetairos offers military equipment. This is not a trivial question affecting exclusively, or even primarily, staging. On the contrary, the answer we provide is significant for the play as a whole: it has to do with the reflection, so central in Birds, on the ontological status of the comic utopia; hence, on the relationship between language and reality.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the feminine in the Aeneid, with particular attention to the patterns, often dissonant, arising from the interaction of gender with social class, the latter broadly conceived. Many of the most influential studies of the feminine in the epic have focused considerable attention on those at the top of the tree, especially the divine females whose status as women is assumed in ways that perhaps gloss over the differential structures of power in the representation of women in the poem.1 In so doing, such studies partake in a multifaceted problem in feminist criticism (and indeed activism): How to focus on the female without reification of femininity into a single form, while nonetheless enabling both solidarity between women of different status, and critical awareness of the injustices suffered by certain groups of women and not others (sometimes at the hands of other individual women or groups of women). I shall attempt to redress the balance by drawing out the specificity of different women’s characters and lives, including especially those at the bottom of the social spectrum in the hierarchical and aristocratic world of epic. This will involve deliberately seeking out some of those at the bottom of the heap, including the nurses and slaves, but also Anna soror, and even the minor goddesses Juturna and Deiopea. I aim to read for difference, for individuality, but in such a way as also to build up a picture of a female world that both engages in and opposes the masculine world of epic and politics. Despite my title, I shall pay only limited attention to major players in the poem, only insofar as they serve to shed light on the minor characters who are my main focus. As a result, there is almost nothing of Dido in this article, or even Lavinia and Camilla.},

  abstract = {In the Ottoman Aegean, repurposed classical sites generated legitimacy from physical continuity with antiquity. These heritage sites were often illustrated in western European travelogues, whose images act as useful windows into their authors’ imperialist worldviews because they depicted Ottoman space as their author saw it, or rather how they wanted to see it. Despite their high value for the study of the physical reception of classical ruins, these travelogue illustrations have received little in-depth analysis. The images represent the travelogue authors’ aim to claim these classical heritage spaces for themselves, and this paper categorises the different visual techniques they used to marginalise Ottoman claims to classical heritage. They stretched reality to depict Ottoman figures as shadowed, lowly, and isolated in contrast to an elevated and gleaming classical past, and they obscured and removed Ottoman buildings or regulated them within classical frames. This paper considers these images in situ alongside the travelogues’ text to prove that these techniques were intentional strategies to de-Ottomanise classical ruins, and highlights evidence from Ottoman Athens, Samos, and Corinth to demonstrate that this trend is consistent throughout the Ottoman Aegean. This widespread campaign of visual de-Ottomanisation is highly pertinent to our understanding of the reception of physical remnants of classical civilisation beyond the page. The authors used visual marginalisation of Ottoman buildings and bodies to justify physically claiming heritage spaces themselves and extracting their artifacts. These images were weapons in an imperial conflict over classical heritage ownership, in which the battlefield spoils were the antiquities themselves.},

  abstract = {One of the commonest clichés in the study of ancient and modern democracy is the claim that the former is ‘direct’, the latter ‘representative’. A few scholars have recently explored areas in which the Classical Athenian democracy had representative features, particularly the magistracies. These studies continue, however, to understand ‘political representation’ according to the definition proposed by the political scientist Hanna Pitkin, that is, as ‘acting [on the part of the political representative] in the interest of the represented, in a manner responsive to them’. In this paper I introduce the insights of the recent ‘constructivist turn’ in studies of political representation to the analysis of Athenian politics in the hope of suggesting, in what will necessarily be a brief and incomplete exercise, how productive this exciting new paradigm can be for understanding the dynamics of ancient democracy. I first lay out the basic tenets of constructivist representation, particularly the notion of the ‘representative claim’ as developed by the political theorist Michael Saward, and argue for their suitability for studying ancient Greek history and political thought. Next, I adapt the model of the representative claim to two episodes of Athenian democratic deliberation, showing how it illuminates processes of demotic will- and identity-formation. I conclude by briefly underscoring how approaching Athenian politics in terms of constructivist notions of representation restores an aesthetic dimension to ancient democratic debate, one that allows us to compare more productively the ‘demos’ of symbouleutic oratory with its counterparts in poetry, sculpture, and other media, namely as a represented object fashioned for creative and rhetorical purposes.},

We used these documents to produce four document embedding models using Stylo R package (word-based, lemma-based, PoS-trigrams-based, and PoS-mask-based) and one document embedding model using mBERT for each of the seven languages. We created further derivations of these embeddings in the form of average, product, minimum, maximum, and l2 norm of these document embedding matrices and tested them both including and excluding the mBERT-based document embeddings for each language. Finally, we trained several perceptrons on the portions of the dataset in order to procure adequate weights for a weighted combination approach. We tested standalone (two baselines) and composite embeddings for classification accuracy, precision, recall, weighted-average, and macro-averaged F1-score, compared them with one another and have found that for each language most of our composition methods outperform the baselines (with a couple of methods outperforming all baselines for all languages), with or without mBERT inputs, which are found to have no significant positive impact on the results of our methods.},

  abstract = {This article examines the constitutive pattern created by the Proustian narrator’s repeated performance as a peeping Tom. Drawing on psychoanalysis, queer studies, visual culture, and affect and performance theories, this study expands the repertoire that has heretofore been limited to homosexual primal scenes by focusing on queer elements linking a number of voyeuristic moments in A` la recherche du temps perdu. As unconventional primal scenes, these passages serve to break down heterosexual/homosexual and man/woman dichotomies through the inclusion of multiple participants of all genders and sexualities. That is, the repetition and authorization of such scenarios function as a performative discourse that advocates for queer sexualities in the novel. In addition to analysis dedicated to the implications of these erotic performances, significant attention is given to the protagonist’s role as voyeur. By highlighting the pleasure that the narrator experiences as a peeping Tom, this article argues that, rather than endeavour to label the Proustian narrator as homosexual or heterosexual, a more productive approach would be to avoid such strict binaries and focus more on his erotic experiences; namely, to view his voyeurism of men and women of various sexual leanings as representative of his sexual preferences.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Ancient languages preserve the cultures and histories of the past. However, their study is fraught with difficulties, and experts must tackle a range of challenging text-based tasks, from deciphering lost languages to restoring damaged inscriptions, to determining the authorship of works of literature. Technological aids have long supported the study of ancient texts, but in recent years advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning have enabled analyses on a scale and in a detail that are reshaping the field of humanities, similarly to how microscopes and telescopes have contributed to the realm of science. This article aims to provide a comprehensive survey of published research using machine learning for the study of ancient texts written in any language, script, and medium, spanning over three and a half millennia of civilizations around the ancient world. To analyze the relevant literature, we introduce a taxonomy of tasks inspired by the steps involved in the study of ancient documents: digitization, restoration, attribution, linguistic analysis, textual criticism, translation, and decipherment. This work offers three major contributions: first, mapping the interdisciplinary field carved out by the synergy between the humanities and machine learning; second, highlighting how active collaboration between specialists from both fields is key to producing impactful and compelling scholarship; third, highlighting promising directions for future work in this field. Thus, this work promotes and supports the continued collaborative impetus between the humanities and machine learning.},

As a public figure, he was elected to important offices by the Athenian demos, but he also had a hand in the abolition of democracy in 411 BC – and then won first prize in the first tragic contest held after democracy was restored. As a dramatist, he frequently gives the impression that the common people are helpless without strong and wise leadership; but he can also suggest that a leader is worth nothing if he neglects his people or ignores their opinions, and in Antigone he seems to go out of his way to highlight the importance of the opinion of the ordinary man as well as that of the elite.},

Because of Circe’s first-person narrative, Miller’s book has been interpreted and marketed as empowering and feminist; however, Circe’s narrative structure rather reaffirms the ideological assumptions underlying the ‘masculine’ Bildungsroman, where the female character’s individual experience is defined by romance and she is ultimately excluded from the social scene. The dichotomy between the marketing rhetoric of empowerment and the novel’s actual narrative structure stimulates a broader reflection about the ideological implication of this novelistic trend as a whole. On the one hand, these novels exploit the well-established exemplary value of Graeco-Roman antiquity to offer a new version of the classical canon which accommodates the critiques of radical movements like feminism; on the other hand, they appropriate the progressive aura of such movements to secure a broader audience while in fact leaving power imbalances unquestioned.},

  abstract = {Bodies abound in Rimbaud’s poetry in a way that is nearly unprecedented in the nineteenth-century poetic canon: lazy, creative, rule-breaking bodies, queer bodies, marginalized and impoverished bodies, revolting and revolutionary, historical bodies. The question that this book seeks to answer is: what does this sheer, corporeal density mean for reading Rimbaud? What kind of sense are we to make of this omnipresence of the body in the Rimbaldian corpus from the earliest poems celebrating the simple delight of running away from wherever one is and stretching one’s legs out under a table, to the ultimate flight away from poetry itself? In response, it argues that the body appears—often literally—as a kind of gap, breach, or aperture through which Rimbaud’s poems enter into contact with history and a larger body of other texts. Simply put, the body is privileged “lyrical material” for Rimbaud: a figure for human beings in their exposed, finite creatureliness               and               in their unpredictable agency and interconnectedness. Its presence in the early work allows us not only to contemplate what a strange, sensuous thing it is to be embodied, to be both singular and part of a collective, it also allows the poet to diagnose, and the reader to perceive, a set of seemingly intractable, real socio-economic, political, and symbolic problems. Rimbaud’s bodies are, in other words, utopian bodies: sites where the historical and the lyrical, the ideal and the material, do not so much cancel each other out as become caught up in one another.},

In this study, we leveraged the AmericasNLP competition to evaluate the translation performance of different systems for Spanish to 11 indigenous languages from South America. Our team, LTLAmsterdam, submitted a total of four systems including GPT-4, a bilingual model, finetuned M2M100, and a combination of finetuned M2M100 with kNN-MT. We found that even large language models like GPT-4 are not well-suited for extremely low-resource languages. Our results suggest that fine-tuning M2M100 models can offer significantly better performance for extremely low-resource translation.},

The method is framed in a construction-based approach to language, i.e. it assumes that grammar consists of signs (form-meaning pairs), and is thus not fundamentally different from the lexicon. The method is applied to linguistic expressions at various levels of abstraction (words, semi-fixed phrases, argument structures, tense, aspect and mood). The method has two main applications: first, to increase the adequacy of grammatical description by providing an objective way of identifying the meaning of a grammatical construction and determining the degree to which particular slots in it prefer or are restricted to a particular set of lexemes; second, to provide data for linguistic theory-building.},

Viewing law as the product not merely of edicts or doctrines but of expressive action, it investigates the performances that literally created law: in civic arenas, courtrooms, and judges’ chambers; on scaffolds; and in the streets. It examines the legal codes, learned treatises, trial reports, lawyers’ manuals, execution narratives, rhetoric books, images (and more) that confronted these performances, praising their virtues or denouncing their evils. In so doing, it recovers a long, rich, and largely overlooked tradition of jurisprudential thought about law as a performance practice. This tradition not only generated an elaborate poetics and politics of legal performance. It provided western jurisprudence with a set of constitutive norms that shaped the very identity of law. That identity emerged, in part, through an opposition: law stood for cool deliberation, by-the-book rules, and sovereign discipline; theatre stood for deceptive artifice, entertainment, histrionics, melodrama. And yet legal performance, even at its most theatrical, also appeared fundamental to law’s realization—a central mechanism for shaping legal subjects, key to persuasion, essential to deterrence, indispensable to law’s power—as it still does today.},

These methods, belonging to the field of Natural Language Processing, have recently been applied to ancient languages; in particular, language modelling has been applied to Ancient Greek, the language on which we focus. In this contribution we explain how vector representations can be computed from word co-occurrences in a corpus and can be used to locate words in a semantic space, and what kind of semantic information can be extracted from language models. We compare three different kinds of language models that can be used to study Ancient Greek semantics: a count-based model, a word embedding model and a syntactic embedding model; and we show examples of how the quality of their representations can be assessed. We highlight the advantages and potential of these methods, especially for the study of semantic change, together with their limitations.},

We represent texts and authors based on their usage of high-frequency words to capture author signatures rather than document topics and measure similarity using JensenShannon Divergence. We then analyze author similarity across centuries, finding high similarity between specific authors and across the corpus that is not common to all languages.},

It was also a period concerned with radical ideas about time put forward by Henri Bergson and Albert Einstein that questioned traditional understandings of the relationship between past and present. This article considers these two aspects of the modernist period through H.D.’s translations of Euripides: it argues that H.D.’s equivocal position in literary modernism and the imagist movement (as demonstrated by her translations from Hippolytus), her prosodic experimentation with Greek verse forms in her translations from Hecuba and Iphigenia at Aulis and finally her emphasis on temporal themes in her Freud-inspired translation of Ion can be all read in such a way to cast new light on the complex temporalities of the translation of classical texts and the modernist reception of the classics.},

  abstract = {Influential writings make the case for open access to research, explore its implications, and document the early struggles and successes of the open access movement.             Peter Suber has been a leading advocate for open access since 2001 and has worked full time on issues of open access since 2003. As a professor of philosophy during the early days of the internet, he realized its power and potential as a medium for scholarship. As he writes now, “it was like an asteroid crash, fundamentally changing the environment, challenging dinosaurs to adapt, and challenging all of us to figure out whether we were dinosaurs.” When Suber began putting his writings and course materials online for anyone to use for any purpose, he soon experienced the benefits of that wider exposure. In 2001, he started a newsletter—the Free Online Scholarship Newsletter, which later became the SPARC Open Access Newsletter—in which he explored the implications of open access for research and scholarship. This book offers a selection of some of Suber's most significant and influential writings on open access from 2002 to 2010.             In these texts, Suber makes the case for open access to research; answers common questions, objections, and misunderstandings; analyzes policy issues; and documents the growth and evolution of open access during its most critical early decade.},

Helen Sword interviewed one hundred academics worldwide about their writing background and practices. Relatively few were trained as writers, she found, and yet all have developed strategies to thrive in their publish-or-perish environment. Sword identifies four cornerstones that anchor any successful writing practice: Behavioral habits of discipline and persistence; Artisanal habits of craftsmanship and care; Social habits of collegiality and collaboration; and Emotional habits of positivity and pleasure. Building on this "BASE," she illuminates the emotional complexity of the writing process and exposes the lack of writing support typically available to early-career academics. She also lays to rest the myth that academics must produce safe, conventional prose or risk professional failure. The successful writers profiled here tell stories of intellectual passions indulged, disciplinary conventions subverted, and risk-taking rewarded. Grounded in empirical research and focused on sustainable change, Air \& Light \& Time \& Space offers a customizable blueprint for refreshing personal habits and creating a collegial environment where all writers can flourish.--},

This serves as a foil for the analysis of the various usages of truth terminology in Plato’s metaphysics and epistemology of “Forms.” Whereas truth is here conceived primarily as a quality of the objects of scientific knowledge, the chapter then also describes the development of a theory of falsehood and truth as qualities of assertions or beliefs in some of Plato’s late works. The section on Aristotle addresses his theory of the declarative sentence, his analysis of propositional truth and falsehood, his theory of the underlying “truth-making” relations, and his ontology of truth-makers. Finally, the chapter also discusses whether the approach we find in Aristotle should be classified as a correspondence theory of truth.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Over the last few decades, there has been tremendous growth in online communication through different types of media. Communication via the Internet is anonymous, which causes a critical issue regarding identity tracing. Authorship identification can apply to tasks such as identifying an anonymous author, detecting plagiarism, or finding a ghostwriter. Previous research has outlined the various methods and their improvements for the identification of anonymous authors based on stylometry. However, changes in the writing style of an author over a long period has not been addressed. In this article, we propose a methodology for author identification where the writing style of an author changes. The proposed methodology consists of two phases: the first will show the change in writing style of the author and in another phase the change is mitigated by a new feature normalization technique. A novel Transform Feature to Current Time function is proposed for normalization, where features are shifted to current time and made available for further classification. A machine-learning algorithm is used to identify an author candidate. The experiments of the proposed methodology conducted on a set of text samples by several authors were collected over a different time period and the results show an improvement in performance.},

Our study assesses LLMs’ proficiency in structuring tables and introduces a novel fine-tuning method, cognizant of data structures, to bolster their performance. We unveil STRUC-BENCH, a comprehensive benchmark featuring prominent LLMs (GPT-NeoX-20B, GPT-3.5, GPT-4, and Vicuna), which spans text tables, HTML, and LaTeX formats. Our proposed FORMATCOT aids in crafting format-specific instructions from the intended outputs to populate this benchmark. Addressing the gap in task-centered evaluation, we propose two innovative metrics, P-Score (Prompting Score) and H-Score (Heuristical Score), to more accurately gauge LLM performance. Our experiments show that applying our structure-aware fine-tuning to LLaMA-7B leads to substantial performance gains, outshining its LLM counterparts across most measures. In-depth error analysis and creating an ability map across six dimensions—coverage, formatting, reasoning, comprehension, pragmatics, and hallucination—highlight areas for future enhancements and suggest forthcoming research trajectories.

  abstract = {Modern accounts of Sicilian history in the late fifth century B.C.E. and its relations with Athens often follow Thucydides’ Athenocentric narrative closely, largely ignoring the Sicilian background. This article instead foregrounds the actions and concerns of two important Sicilian cities, Segesta and Leontini, whose perspectives Thucydides chose to leave out or downplay. In particular, Segesta was involved in the complex cross-cultural dynamics of western Sicily, while Leontini demonstrated resilience in its resistance to Syracusan imperialism. Both cities’ relations with Athens emerged from their pre-existing policies and strategies. This article thus develops an alternate narrative of these events that complements Thucydides’ Athenocentric one. To accomplish this, it argues for a more nuanced approach to Thucydides’ narrative: reading it against the grain, supplementing it with data from Diodorus and epigraphy, and placing it in its Sicilian historical and cultural context. In this way, the article develops a new approach to the methodological issues involved in writing the history of poleis that are not emphasized in major extant narrative sources. Recognizing Segesta and Leontini as political actors with their own goals and agendas enables both a new reading of Thucydides and a less Athenocentric account of late fifth-century Sicilian history.},

  abstract = {Toward the end of the year A.D. 8, the emperor Augustus publicly sentenced the poet Ovid to exile in remote and barbaric Tomis on the Black Sea. The action presumably followed a secret hearing before the emperor, and the official reason given for the sentence was Ovid's authorship of a licentious work, the Ars amatoria, ten years earlier. The Mystery of Ovid's Exile is both a survey and an analysis of the literary detective work that has been devoted to explaining the cause of Ovid's banishment from Rome. In poems composed during his exile, Ovid laments having written the Ars amatoria, but he obviously considers the poem to be merely a pretext for his punishment. His downfall appears to have been caused by his having witnessed, or in some fashion been implicated in, a crime committed either by the emperor himself or by an immediate member of the imperial family. However, it's possible that Ovid's banishment may have been ordered merely because he was unwittingly in possession of the key to an embarrassing secret, the importance of which he might have realized had he remained in Rome. John C. Thibault examines more than one hundred available hypotheses that have been advanced by inquisitive scholars from the Middle Ages to our own day. He demonstrates the unsoundness of each hypothesis in turn, and suggests that a solution to the problem of Ovid's exile is not possible given the available evidence. The Mystery of Ovid's Exil treats a controversy that will fascinate classical scholars as well as general readers interested in Roman manners and morals of the period.

The article has two primary objectives. First, it suggests the added value of captions in making digitized illustrations more searchable by picture content in online archives. To further this objective, we describe the methods we have used to identify captions, which can effectively be re-purposed and applied in different contexts. Second, we suggest how this research leads to new understandings of the semantics and significance of the captions of historical book illustrations. The findings discussed here mark a critical intervention in the fields of digital humanities, book history, and illustration studies.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article sets Euripides’ Bacchae in dialogue with Goran Stefanovski’s Bahanalii, a play that was performed in the immediate aftermath of Yugoslavia’s break-up. Contrapuntal reading shows how the two plays problematize conservative epistemologies by imagining their borderlands as privileged sites of knowledge production. Euripides’ Bacchae opens with a Dionysus who arrives on stage from a faraway land where Greeks and non-Greeks live mixed together. My reading of this passage challenges Edward Said’s interpretation of the Bacchae as a play about the dangers of ‘what lies beyond familiar borders’. Instead, the Bacchae performs an exercise in literary imagination in which a border-minded worldview responds to Athens’ dwindling geopolitical prestige, resists narratives of Greek exceptionalism inherited in the aftermath of the Persian wars, and foresees a return to a kind of Hellenic balkanization avant la lettre. In Bahanalii, Stefanovski resists idealizing mindsets by staging a contradictory Dionis, one that focalizes the epistemological power of the border, while also embodying the uncanny poltergeist of the violence that plagued Yugoslavia in the 1990s. In juxtaposing the narratives of Yugoslav and ancient Athenian exceptionalism, this comparison unlocks a ‘balkanizing’ paradigm of classical reception which complements and complicates existing theoretical accounts of classical reception.},

In the immediate context the light of the beacon relieves the watchman of his toil and brings joy to Argos. The image, however, is not totally positive. The fire signal announces both the fall of Troy and the return of Agamemnon to Clytemnestra. The negative aspect, furthermore, is emphasised at the opening — the watchman's joy at seeing the beacon (lines 22ff.) gives way at line 36 to foreboding (               τ⋯ δ' ἄλλα σιγ⋯               ). For the original audience of 458 b.c. I suggest that this fire beacon proclaiming victory must have conveyed other negative overtones. In brief, it will have recalled to them vividly the signals used by the Persian commanders during the great invasion of 480 to announce Athens' capture to an expectant Persian court.},

Within this history, the sublime has been a category reserved for awe-inspiring and overwhelming experiences, in which the finite subject is dwarfed by a more expansive force. Despite subjectivity being foremost in this topic, what has been overlooked, is the role the body plays in being the centre of aesthetic experience. In this paper, I will turn the tide on this omission and thematize the role of the body within the experience of the sublime. My plan for reconsidering this movement is to unite Werner Herzog’s Aguirre, Wrath of God (1972) with the late thought of Merleau-Ponty, especially his enigmatic notion of "flesh" (Merleau-Ponty, 1968). In both Herzog and Merleau-Ponty, a philosophy of nature exists which challenges the dichotomy between the autonomous self encountering the objective realm of wilderness. In each case, an ambiguity undercuts the idea of wilderness existing "there" while human subjectivity remains placed "here." I will "read" the film as an instant of the chiasmatic relation between nature and humanity. Doing so, I will suggest that the reversibility between the body and the environment can be seen as an amplification of Merleau-Ponty’s notion of "wild being" (l’etre sauvage).},

  abstract = {Abstract             This article argues that the abuse of costume by the women in Lysistrata and Ecclesiazusae displays their dominance over the men while underscoring their femininity. This is particularly important in a genre where women in power are commonly viewed as masculine or androgynous. Furthermore, the use of costume reflects fundamental concerns about female power in each fictional type of gynecocracy. In Lysistrata the handling of costume alludes to ritualistic practices which emphasize the women’s (positive) contribution to civic welfare, and articulates the women’s efforts towards the restoration of the institution of marriage and the former (male) political order. Conversely, in Ecclesiazusae the mutual cross-dressing highlights the men’s impotence and sterility, and reflects the consequences of the abolition of marriage and the subversion of the male order.},

  abstract = {Erich Auerbach (1903-1957) and Theodor Adorno (1903-1969) were two of the many German Jewish intellectuals who left National Socialist Germany in the 1930s. Recent scholarship within Classics has paid attention to the critical readings of Homer’s Odyssey that both men produced in exile, that is, the first chapter of Auerbach’s Mimesis, the Representation of Reality in Western Literature (1946) and the first excursus of Dialectic of Enlightenment (1947) written by Adorno in collaboration with Max Horkheimer. This dissertation investigates, through the notion of ‘exile’, how the critical reception of antiquity operated in the wider thought of Adorno and Auerbach. I seek to show how Auerbach and Adorno develop powerful critical positions in articulating their alienation from the particular forms of philhellenism that had anchored German philology and philosophy.   This dissertation falls into two halves reflecting the manner of Adorno and Auerbach’s engagements with classical antiquity. The first half examines Auerbach and Adorno’s direct receptions, that is, their readings of Homer. Chapter One investigates how Auerbach adduces a Judeo-Christian notion of the sublime and thus challenges the critieria by which Homer was held up as an aesthetic ideal. Through Adorno’s notion of ‘epic naïveté’, Chapter Two shows how the Frankfurt thinker reads the Odyssey as an aesthetic object and therefore as a potential resource of liberation, as well as the Grundtext for the barbarism of Western civilization.   The second half of this dissertation examines Adorno and Auerbach’s responses to the philhellenic organisation of scholarly methods. Chapter Three argues that Auerbach reconfigures the notion of Weltliteratur, replacing Goethe’s original formulation of the Greeks as the paradigm for this concept. Chapter Four examines the philosophical conseuqences of Adorno’s choice of ps. Aristotle’s Magna Moralia for the title of his 1951 collection of aphorisms Minima Moralia.  I show how Adorno frames an ethic of homelessness, as a response to the violence of modernity, through recourse to an image of damaged Hellenism.    This dissertation argues that Adorno and Auerbach provide a dialectical model of classical reception that is deeply sensitive to the political conditions in which the very idea of antiquity is formulated.},

We choose as a case study the plays of William Shakespeare, presumably the most renowned and respected dramatist in the history of literature. Previous research in the field of authorship attribution has shown that the writing style of an author can be characterized and distinguished from that of other authors automatically. The question we propose to answer is a related but different one: can the styles of different characters be distinguished? We aim to verify in this way if an author managed to create believable characters with individual styles, and focus on Shakespeare’s iconic characters. We present our experiments using various features and models, including an SVM and a neural network, show that characters in Shakespeare’s plays can be classified with up to 50\% accuracy.},

Nor is the scepter a mystical talisman - rather, at its simplest level it is a cudgel, a symbol of the ruling class' power to inflict humiliating punishment on their inferiors.},

  abstract = {"Drawing on ancient writers, from Aesop to Ovid, classicist and working farmer, Mark Usher compiles in this book an anthology of Greco-Roman passages illustrating how they thought about animals and illuminating they might help us to rethink our relationships with them. Not many contemporary readers will know, for example, the compelling arguments the second century AD Greek philosopher Porphyry makes for vegetarianism, long before a plant-based diet began to garner headlines. Plutarch's serio-comic exposition of the rationality and inherent dignity of non-human creatures-put on the lips of one of Circe's pigs-is so fresh that it sounds like it was formulated just yesterday. The knowledge the poet Theognis derived from Greek sponge divers about the behavior of octopods rivals our contemporary fascination with the octopus. Aristotle's introduction to the scientific study of animal morphology and behavior remains unparalleled for its elegance and insight, and it represents one of the first forays into natural history writing. Seneca, employing an ingenious etymological pun on the word animal, endeavors to show that we humans are morally inferior to our animal cousins, who instinctively know and are satisfied with their place in Nature. The Greeks and Romans, amidst all their magnificent cultural achievements and reckless, destructive behavior, lived closer than most of us to the perils and prospects of their environments. This afforded them a sensitivity to their environments and, in particular, to their fellow creatures that can perhaps help to disabuse us of our disconnectedness from animal life. This small volume demonstrates how astoundingly relevant the ancients still are in this regard" ; "An entertaining and enlightening anthology of classical Greek and Roman writings on animals-and our vital relationships with themHow to Care about Animals is a fascinating menagerie of passages from classical literature about animals and the lives we share with them. Drawing on ancient writers from Aesop to Ovid, classicist and farmer M. D. Usher has gathered a healthy litter of selections that reveal some of the ways Greeks and Romans thought about everything from lions, bears, and wolves to birds, octopuses, and snails-and that might inspire us to rethink our own relationships with our fellow creatures. Presented in lively new translations, with the original texts on facing pages, these pieces are filled with surprises-anticipating but also offering new perspectives on many of our current feelings and ideas about animals.Here, Porphyry makes a compelling argument for vegetarianism and asserts that the just treatment of animals makes us better people; Pliny the Elder praises the virtuosity of songbirds and the virtuousness of elephants; Plutarch has one of Circe's pigs from the Odyssey make a serio-comic case for the dignity of the beasts of the field; Aristotle puts the study of animals on par with anthropology; we read timeless Aesopian fables, including "The Hen That Laid the Golden Egg" and "The Fox and the Grapes"; and there is much, much more.A Noah's Ark of a book, How to Care about Animals is guaranteed to charm and inspire anyone who loves animals"},

If one understands remembering as reconstructing the past, this reconstructive element leaves room for forgery and deception. Telling credible lies involves many of the same cognitive structures used in the sharing of authentic personal memories. Odysseus’ fake autobiographical stories in the guise of a Cretan beggar offer an interesting case study of this overlap between reconstructed memories and credible lies. Drawing on recent studies on autobiographical memory and on parallel examples in our contemporary world, the aim of this paper is to analyse some narrative and psychological features of Odysseus’ fake memories, as well as the social functions that they fulfil in the fiction of the poem. It will be shown that, speaking with Eumaios, Odysseus builds his story using a conventional structure common to ‘truthful’ autobiographies in the fictional world of the epics, while with Penelope his autobiographical memories are co-narrated during the dialogue, guided by the emotions mutually aroused between narrator and narratee.},

Arguing that the widespread view on the confrontation between Antigone and Creon as a clash between ‘divine’ and ‘human’ law is mistaken, the article builds on Hegel’s view that the positions of both protagonists are likewise incomplete, denying elements of law and justice that are equally essential, the one being no less divine than the other. However, it departs from Hegel’s analysis in maintaining that the play does not entail the promise of ‘ethical life’ (Sittlichkeit) as some synthesis that recognizes the specific value of both Antigone’s and Creon’s stances on law and justice but takes away their incompatibility. Instead, it is argued that the play teaches us that such harmonization is unattainable – a no less valuable lesson indeed.},

  abstract = {The growing field of historical game studies (which studies the intersection of history and video games) has often described video games with historical settings as virtual museums, based on their potential to allow players to move through a historical game space and/or interact with historical artefacts. The present article investigates how these insights may be applied to mythological video games (i.e. those that represent and simulate a storyworld known from or inspired by mythological traditions). Specifically, this article argues (1) that through the collection, combination, and presentation of different myths, mythological video games often exhibit characteristics similar to ancient and modern mythography, (2) that on the basis of these mythographical qualities, they may be considered as interactive mythology museums, and (3) that the incorporation of these features has potential for applications in education. As case studies, this article considers the popular games Age of Mythology, Smite, Immortals Fenyx Rising, God of War (and its sequel, God of War: Ragnarök), Apotheon, and Hades in light of their mythographical and museal properties. Finally, several future directions to further improve upon the educational potential of these games for both formal and informal learning are suggested.},

  abstract = {Thanks to easy-to-use data analysis tools and digital infrastructures, even those humanities scholars who lack programming skills can work with large-scale empirical datasets in order to disclose patterns and correlations within them. Although empirical research trends have existed throughout the history of the humanities [Bod 2013], these recently emergent possibilities have revived an empiricist attitude among humanities scholars schooled in more critical and interpretive traditions. Replying to calls for a critical digital humanities [Berry and Fagerjord 2017] [Dobson 2019], this paper explores “tool criticism” [Van Es et al. 2018] – a critical attitude required of digital humanities scholars when working with computational tools and digital infrastructures. First, it explores tool criticism as a response to instrumentalism in the digital humanities and proposes it to be part of what a critical digital humanities does. Second, it analyses tool criticism as practice, in practice. Concretely, it discusses two critical making–inspired workshops in which participants explored the affordances of digital tools and infrastructures and their underlying assumptions and values. The first workshop focused on “games-as-tools” [Werning 2020]. Participants in the workshop engaged with the constraints, material and mechanical, of a card game by making modifications to it. In the second workshop, drawing on the concept of “digital infrapuncture” [Verhoeven 2016], participants examined digital infrastructure in terms of capacity and care. After first identifying “hurt” in a chat environment, they then designed bots to intervene in that hurt and offer relief.},

I demonstrate how these minor characters function as Virgil’s illustrations of Aeneas’ movement away from the Homeric world, as the text progresses towards the proto-Roman project that features prominently in the Aeneid’s narrative.},

The texts chosen for this experiment are Homer, Iliad 1.1–279 and Lysias 7. The results suggest that lemmatization methods using large lexica as well as part-of-speech tagging—such as those employed by the Diorisis corpus and the cltk backoff lemmatizer—are more reliable than methods that rely more heavily on machine learning and use smaller lexica.},

The significant contribution this article presents is to demonstrate how word vector models can be used to explore the way concepts have shifted in meaning over time, as they migrated across space, by comparing newspapers from different countries published between 1840 and 1914. We define a concept, rather pragmatically, as a key term or core idea that has been used in historical discourse: an abstraction or mental representation that has served as a building block for thoughts and beliefs. We use historical newspapers in English, Finnish, German and Swedish from collections in the UK, US, Germany, and Finland, as well as the Europeana collection. As use cases, we analyze how the different conceptual constructs of “nation” and “illness” emerged and changed between 1840 and 1920. Conceptual change over time is simulated by creating a series of overlapping word vector models, each spanning ten years. Historical vocabularies are retrieved on the basis of vector space proximity. Conceptual change across space is simulated by comparing the historical change of vocabularies in newspaper collections from different nations in several languages. This computational approach to conceptual history opens up new ways to identify patterns in public discourse over longer periods of time and across borders.},

Both Una sola muerte numerosa (1997) by Argentinian Nora Strejilevich, and Antígona González (2012) by Mexico’s Sara Uribe explore the capacity of collective memory to resist violence. Following theorists Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari, I use the term “rhizomatic violence” to describe forced disappearances in Argentina and Mexico as well as the imprints they leave in memory. The rewriting of Antigone in these two experimental literary texts record memories, but also create them, becoming the “symbol of the sign” in the Derridean concepts of “Temporalization” and the “Trace.” In these configurations, memories as time are fragmented, juxtaposed, and linked to each other to make sense of the traumatic experiences of forced disappearances, allowing us to re-imagine a collective future.},

  abstract = {Lies spread faster than the truth                            There is worldwide concern over false news and the possibility that it can influence political, economic, and social well-being. To understand how false news spreads, Vosoughi               et al.               used a data set of rumor cascades on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. About 126,000 rumors were spread by ∼3 million people. False news reached more people than the truth; the top 1\% of false news cascades diffused to between 1000 and 100,000 people, whereas the truth rarely diffused to more than 1000 people. Falsehood also diffused faster than the truth. The degree of novelty and the emotional reactions of recipients may be responsible for the differences observed.                                         Science               , this issue p.               1146                        ,              A large-scale analysis of tweets reveals that false rumors spread further and faster than the truth.           ,              We investigated the differential diffusion of all of the verified true and false news stories distributed on Twitter from 2006 to 2017. The data comprise \textasciitilde 126,000 stories tweeted by \textasciitilde 3 million people more than 4.5 million times. We classified news as true or false using information from six independent fact-checking organizations that exhibited 95 to 98\% agreement on the classifications. Falsehood diffused significantly farther, faster, deeper, and more broadly than the truth in all categories of information, and the effects were more pronounced for false political news than for false news about terrorism, natural disasters, science, urban legends, or financial information. We found that false news was more novel than true news, which suggests that people were more likely to share novel information. Whereas false stories inspired fear, disgust, and surprise in replies, true stories inspired anticipation, sadness, joy, and trust. Contrary to conventional wisdom, robots accelerated the spread of true and false news at the same rate, implying that false news spreads more than the truth because humans, not robots, are more likely to spread it.},

The essay traces how the original idea of “humanizing physicians” evolved and how crises from death and dying, to AIDS and COVID-19, expanded humanistic inquiry into health, illness, and the human condition. It examines how a wide array of scholars, professional organizations, disciplinary approaches, academic units, and intellectual agendas came to define the vibrant field. This remarkable growth offers a counterpoint to narratives of decline in the humanities. It is a story of growing relevance shaped by tragedy, of innovative programs in medical schools and on undergraduate campuses, and vital new configurations of ethics, literature, the arts, and history that breathed new life into the study of health and medicine.},

The article refers to key developments in the epigraphy and paleography of the premodern period. It draws primarily on work in classical studies but also highlights related work in the adjacent disciplines of Egyptology, ancient Near East studies, and medieval studies. The argument makes a case that much has been achieved but it does not declare “mission accomplished.” The capabilities of the infrastructure remain unevenly distributed within and across disciplines, institutions, and regions. Moreover, the components, including the links between steps in the workflow, are generally far from user-friendly and seamless in operation. Because further refinements and additional capacities are still much needed, the article concludes with a discussion of key priorities for future work.},

Analyzing the play’s allusions to Odyssey 23, this article argues that Helen raises expectations of a bed as sign in the recognition scene between Helen and Menelaus, an expectation that the recognition scene fulfills by positing the eidolon as an ‘empty bed’. After the couple’s delayed recognition, the tomb of Proteus replaces the phantom as material sign of the couple’s union, a solid ‘bed’ that enables their escape and is subsequently incorporated into an evolving discourse of signs known only to them. The cenotaph employed in the couple’s escape plan troubles this discourse of signs by replacing the material tomb with an empty one.},

Drawing from theater scholarship on the phenomenology of space, I show how tragedians and comedians alike experimented with how to shape their audience’s understanding of a play’s setting. I focus on opening scenes in plays by Sophocles and Aristophanes where a character sees with and for the audience, and demonstrate how these moments of staged spectatorship are not necessarily straightforward or seamless; they can facilitate the viewing of dramatic space but also, by laying it bare, reveal its complications. Sometimes there are multiple representational possibilities for physical space within and around the theater; sometimes physical and fictional space are to be seen simultaneously; sometimes the representational gap between physical and fictional space is kept open for a surprisingly long time. Such exposure of the process of theatrical representation, I argue, can draw the audience in as a co-participant in a drama’s production.},

Classical drama frequently exposes and interrogates potential viewing experiences within the theatron-literally, "the place for seeing." Weiss shows how, in doing so, it demands distinctive modes of engagement from its audiences. Examining plays and pots with attention to the instability and ambiguity inherent to visual perception, Seeing Theater provides an entirely new model for understanding this ancient artform"--},

Produced by slaveholders, inventories are strongly biased toward representing owners and managers as responsible for the names they record; yet they can also provide glimpses of slave self-naming. The uneven and sometimes contradictory ways in which the names’ meanings evolved precludes any single generalization about who gave them. The ubiquitous Akan-derived daynames, rapidly domesticated and widely adopted, must be considered separately from other names originating in Africa.},

  abstract = {The play has given rise to diverse interpretations. The greatest divergence of opinion is about the attitude of Sophocles to the matricidal vengeance. At one extreme we have a robust Homeric Sophocles, untroubled by the squeamishness of Aeschylus; at the other, an Aeschylean sensitiveness to the moral implications of the vengeance and a presumption that the Furies are only waiting for the play to end to begin their pursuit of Orestes. Adherents of the former view can point to certain epic features which Sophocles has introduced, but the constant reminiscences of the               Oresteia               are far more striking. This paper assumes (what will be in part substantiated) that Sophocles wrote with the               Oresteia               constantly in mind and expected the better-educated among his audience to be reminded of it. It will be concerned particularly with the Sophoclean treatment of the Furies and will suggest that this is of fundamental importance to the interpretation of the play.},

In Antiphon 1 Against the Stepmother the speaker calls his stepmother Clytemnestra. By this pointed tragic allusion he hopes to prejudge the stepmother’s liability. But the stepmother also evokes another, more sympathetic, tragic model, Sophocles’ Deianira. The tension between these two dramatic models of female intent introduces tragic ambiguities into the legal brief and reveals both the possibilities and the dangers of tragedy as a vehicle for jurisprudential thought.},

M. Pohlenz,                   Herodot, der erste Geschichtschreiber des Abendlandes                   (1937)                                                                         Anyone familiar with Greek literature knows at once that this can describe no author but Herodotus. As readers have long recognized, travel is a crucial element of Herodotus’ persona not only as an historian and ethnographer but also as a narrator, to the extent that he has been called a tourist and a guide. Pohlenz draws his vivid metaphor from Herodotus himself, who assimilates movement through his narrative to movement through space by several well-known narratorial habits: he points out ‘paths’ of               logoi               (1.95.1: λόγων ὁδούς), goes out of his way to justify so-called ‘digressions’ (or               Exkurse               ) and frequently uses verbs of movement to return to earlier narratives or to preview upcoming ones. However, most scholars have overlooked one important feature by which Herodotus creates this sense of progress through his               logoi               , although it appears in the programmatic sentence that begins his whole network of narrative signposts and recurs in his voice in the first half of the               Histories               and in important speeches in the second.},

  urldate = {2023-01-09},
  abstract = {Certain Greek texts depict Helen in a manner that connects her elusive body with the elusive maneuvers of the persuasive story. Her too-mobile body signals in these texts the obscurity of agency in the seduction scene and serves as a device for tracking the dynamics of desire. In so doing this body propels poetic narrative and gives structure to persuasive argumentation. Although the female figure in traditional texts is always the object of male representation, in this study I examine a set of images of a female body whose representation ultimately seems to frustrate the narrative strategies for which its depiction was created. What emerges in the fifth century as a rhetorical technique begins in Book 3 of the Iliad as a narrative strategy that uses Helen's cloaked and disappearing body to catalyze plot, and develops in Sappho's fr. 16 into a logic of desire shaped by the movement of Helen's and other bodies in the visual field. Gorgias, in the Encomium of Helen, transforms these depictions of Helen into an argument that is structured by Helen's body, an argument that Helen herself employs in Euripides' Troades, where her own body serves as the anatomy of her argument. These texts all associate Helen's body with a type of persuasive narrative that repeatedly invokes the field of vision, describing physical presence in terms that aim at attracting the eye. At the same time this verbal portraiture disrupts the audience's perspective by depicting bodies as cloaked, mobile, and/or half seen, and by obscuring distinctions between desirer and desired, viewer and viewed. As both subject and object in this viewing process, Helen's body comes to be associated with the double vision of seduction (i.e., the shunting of her body from desiring eye to desired object) and the distracting power of persuasive images, which seduce the mind's eye while eluding the mind's grasp.},

  abstract = {Abstract             This essay explores the dynamics that surround the figuring and staging of bodies in the Electra plays – especially dead bodies, but also living ones that are represented as approximate and / or proximate to corpses. Interacting with such bodies intensifies agony and transport for characters and audiences alike, both of which affects plunge toward sublimity. At the same time the strongly gendered familial dynamics of pivotal scenes inflect the emotional shudder that attends them with a psychic recoil, as mothers haunt sons and sisters seek to lie down with brothers or other ‘wrong’ objects of affection. Focusing on how Orestes and especially Electra position themselves in relation to these bodies, the essay argues that they operate as sublime and uncanny objects, attracting the living into confrontation with their perverse pleasures and stimulating aesthetic and affective reactions that are central to tragic mimesis.},

Because these texts co-exist in an integrated digital library, readers can exploit a suite of tools to discover new relationships and ask new questions. Perseus’s dense interlinking does more than make connections explicit, however: it foregrounds them in a way that is troubling to those who worry that disturbing the traditional hierarchy of primary sources and secondary commentary will draw readers away from close contact with literature. Despite its shortcomings, the Perseus Garner suggests an aim for this research: a hypervariorum whose mode of conceptualizing and rendering the relationship of text and annotation challenges the traditional model of “perpetual commentary” and promises to denature synthetic criticism into a full, turbid stream of scholarly discovery and critical opinion.},

This discussion offers fresh observations about the humor generated from Philocleon’s costume change and identifies its “intertextual” relationship with Aeschylus’s Oresteia, Aristophanes’s Acharnians and Knights. The ‘cloak scene,’ it is argued, forms an integral part of the ongoing competition between the comic and tragic genre in Wasps. Moreover, this case study points to the on-going significance of costume in Aristophanes’s dialectic with tragedy and in his discourse on theatre in general.},

I then suggest that Plato alludes to this playful tradition in his own portrayal of Hermes, who, like Protagoras, is concerned with the distribution and promotion of “political skill.”},

NER research is often focused on flat entities only (flat NER), ignoring the fact that entity references can be nested, as in [Bank of [China]] (Finkel and Manning, 2009). In this paper, we use ideas from graph-based dependency parsing to provide our model a global view on the input via a biaffine model (Dozat and Manning, 2017). The biaffine model scores pairs of start and end tokens in a sentence which we use to explore all spans, so that the model is able to predict named entities accurately. We show that the model works well for both nested and flat NER through evaluation on 8 corpora and achieving SoTA performance on all of them, with accuracy gains of up to 2.2 percentage points.},

  abstract = {This richly illustrated work provides a new and deeper perspective on the interaction of visual representation and classical culture from the fifth century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. Drawing on a variety of source materials, including Greco-Roman literature, historiography, and philosophy, coupled with artistic renderings, Paul Zanker forges the first comprehensive history of the visual representation of Greek and Roman intellectuals. He takes the reader from the earliest visual images of Socrates and Plato to the figures of Christ, the Apostles, and contemporaneous pagan and civic dignitaries. Through his interpretations of the postures, gestures, facial expressions, and stylistic changes of particular pieces, we come to know these great poets and philosophers through all of their various personas-the prophetic wise man, the virtuous democratic citizen, or the self-absorbed bon vivant. Zanker's analysis of how the iconography of influential thinkers and writers changed demonstrates the rise and fall of trends and the movement of schools of thought and belief, each successively embodying the most valued characteristics of the period and culture. This title is part of UC Press's Voices Revived program, which commemorates University of California Press's mission to seek out and cultivate the brightest minds and give them voice, reach, and impact. Drawing on a backlist dating to 1893, Voices Revived makes high-quality, peer-reviewed scholarship accessible once again using print-on-demand technology.

  abstract = {This article surveys the presence of classical antiquity in the writing of José Rizal (1861–1896), the national hero of the Philippines. It first discusses Rizal’s Jesuit education and considers an example of his early fiction, The Council of the Gods (El consejo de los dioses, 1880), before outlining the employment of Latin and classical references in his two major novels, Noli me tángere and El filibusterismo. I argue that allusion to classical antiquity plays a range of roles in Rizal’s work: it allows him to adopt a refined persona, deflate the prestige of the Dominican and Franciscan orders, satirize the pretensions of the educated classes and advance the cause of reason and enlightenment in the Philippines. While Latin is at times portrayed as a cudgel wielded by priests and cultural conservatives, it is also revealed to be a tool essential for radical critique of inherited religious dogma. In El filibusterismo, the stories of Antaeus and the Trojan War are put to incisive anticolonial use. As such, Rizal’s writing represents an important moment in the globalized classical tradition at the end of the nineteenth century.},

  abstract = {Exploring the comparative analysis of translation styles across languages holds great significance for capturing the essence of ancient Chinese classics. This article presents a comprehensive analysis of language models for linguistic examination of ancient Chinese classics, using the crosslanguage Zuozhuan corpus as a focal point. We utilize the capabilities of five pre-trained language models to compare their effectiveness with the deep learning model Bi-LSTM-CRF in the areas of word segmentation and parts-of-speech tagging. Optimal training results obtained from the models facilitated the completion of word segmentation and parts-of-speech tagging across the entire corpus of ancient Chinese classics. Building on these advancements, this research delves into a meticulous lexical-level scrutiny of the linguistic style evident in ancient Chinese classics and their corresponding English translations. In contrast to the original Chinese text, the contemporary Chinese translation exhibits greater semantic clarity, manifesting a relatively singular phrase function and a heightened diversity in vocabulary combinations. Conversely, the English translation demonstrates a tendency toward simplification. The analysis encompasses facets such as parts of speech distribution, word length variation, lexical richness, and textual density, providing unprecedented insights into the crosslinguistic nuances of these venerable literary works.},

This is true especially for parallel treebanks, of which very few exist. The ones that exist are mainly hand-crafted and too small for reliable use in data-oriented applications. In this paper we introduce a novel platform for fast and robust automatic generation of parallel treebanks. The software we have developed based on this platform has been shown to handle large data sets. We also present evaluation results demonstrating the quality of the derived treebanks and discuss some possible modifications and improvements that can lead to even better results. We expect the presented platform to help boost research in the field of dataoriented machine translation and lead to advancements in other fields where parallel treebanks can be employed.},
